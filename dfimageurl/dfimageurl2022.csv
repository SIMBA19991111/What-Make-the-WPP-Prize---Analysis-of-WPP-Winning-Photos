0,1,Kamloops Residential School,"19 June, 2021","Red dresses hung on crosses along a roadside commemorate children who died at the Kamloops Indian Residential School, an institution created to assimilate Indigenous children, following the detection of as many as 215 unmarked graves, Kamloops, British Columbia.The hanging of red dresses as a visual response to the disproportionate violence faced by women with an Indigenous heritage began in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 2011; orange shirts are also used, specifically to acknowledge suffering caused to children by the residential school system in Canada. Residential schools began operating in the 19th century as part of a policy of assimilating people from various Indigenous communities into Western, and predominantly Christian culture. Students were removed from their homes and parents – frequently by force – and often forbidden to communicate in their own languages. Their hair was cut short, and they had to wear uniforms, rather than traditional clothing, were given Euro-Christian names in place of their own, and were subject to physical and sometimes sexual abuse. Supreme Court Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin claimed Canada used the institutions to commit cultural genocide.","Upwards of 150,000 children passed through the doors of residential schools before the last one closed in 1996. A Truth and Reconciliation Commission, set up in 2009, concluded that at least 4,100 students died while at the schools, as a result of mistreatment, neglect, disease or accident. The Kamloops School, established in 1890, became the largest in the system, attended by hundreds of Secwépemc and other First Nations children. It closed in 1978. In May 2021, a survey using ground-penetrating radar identified as many as 215 potential juvenile burial sites at Kamloops – confirming reports from oral histories.",2022 Photo Contest,North and Central America,Singles,"This winner represents the awakening of a shameful history that is finally being addressed in Canada. It is a perfect image which captures a rare light, and is at once haunting, arresting, and symbolic. The sensory image offers a quiet moment of reckoning with the global legacy of colonization and exploitation, while amplifying the voices of First Nations communities who are demanding justice. The single image requires an active eye, and encourages us to hold governments, social institutions, and ourselves accountable. ",https://www.worldpressphoto.org/getmedia/9ed88778-bc89-4c25-a2d9-9d26307a530e/WPP_2022Contest_North-and-Central-America_SIN_Amber-Bracken.jpg?maxsidesize=1920&resizemode=force,F:\Temp\2022\Amber Bracken\1.jpg,Amber Bracken,2022

11,1,Political Year Zero,"18 December, 2019","An aide to Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi adjusts a row of flags in front of a painting of George Washington, at the US Capitol, while preparing for Democratic leaders to speak after the vote to impeach President Donald Trump, on 18 December 2019 – the first of two occasions on which Trump was impeached. The US House of Representatives impeached the president for abusing his power by trying to coerce Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden, then a leading contender for the Democratic nomination to run against him, by allegedly threatening to withhold military aid. A second charge was laid  against the president for obstructing Congress by ordering his administration to not cooperate with the investigation. Trump was later acquitted on both charges by the US Senate.The final year of Donald Trump’s presidency of the US, saw increasing polarization in the country, growing social unrest, and burgeoning disinformation in the media. From early in the run-up to the 2020 US election, President Trump began to make accusations of judicial and electoral subversion. Unrest among his supporters grew into insurrection, culminating in a 6 January 2021 attack on the United States Capitol Building in Washington DC. The photographer has lived in the US capital for more than 15 years documenting social and political issues, and wished to examine and give insight into the background behind the 6 January attack. ","As COVID-19 took hold from early 2020, the president was criticized for his handling of the pandemic, and for undermining scientists and spreading conspiracy theories rather than encouraging mask wearing and social distancing. The murder of George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, who died while being arrested by Minneapolis police on 25 May 2020, led to protests in support of the Black Lives Matter movement by between 15 million and 26 million people nationwide.

The photographer says he would like to give social issues and struggling minorities greater visibility and a better future through his work. Following his photographs and subsequent media coverage, members of the central government intervened and evicted residents from San Isidro were promised rehousing and compensation. They were resettled in temporary shelter, but by early 2022 had still not been relocated to new land.Authorities said the railroad megaproject would bring work and investment to the area, and that the ground did not officially belong to the people being evicted. Economic hardship during the COVID pandemic led to growing numbers of people living in informal settlements around Colombia, with frequent evictions. People in San Isidro, many of whom were of African descent, from Chocó, in the west of the country, or belonged to the Embera Chami community, lived in makeshift shelters, without basic services.

A fire that raged for more than two months in 2015 was one of the worst fires on record this century, destroying some 26,000 km2 of land, an area half the size of Costa Rica. Fire haze, which at times reaches neighboring countries, can affect human health, especially as it carries fine particulate matter, which can penetrate deep into the lungs. A Harvard University study linked the 2015 haze to more than 100,000 premature deaths in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. UNICEF said that wildfires across Kalimantan and Sumatra in 2019 put nearly 10 million children at risk from air pollution.The accelerating wildfire rate is also jeopardizing the country’s progress in reducing deforestation (thus contributing to global heating, as trees absorb CO2). In addition, fires on peat-rich islands such as Borneo and Sumatra have a further impact, as when peat burns it releases massive amounts of CO2 into the environment.Fires usually peak in the July–October dry season. Dry conditions make it easier for fires to be set to clear land for agriculture, but also more likely that they spread out of control. Indonesia is the world’s largest producer of palm oil and industrial-scale land clearance has increased the risk of wildfire immensely.

Fire haze, which at times reaches neighboring countries, can affect human health, especially as it carries fine particulate matter, which can penetrate deep into the lungs. A Harvard University study linked the 2015 haze to more than 100,000 premature deaths in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore.

74,1,Ukraine Crisis,"19 December, 2013","A decapitated statue of Lenin stands in Cheminots Park, Kotovsk, Ukraine, on 19 December 2013. The statue was destroyed by ultra-nationalists on the night of 8–9 December.In November 2013, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Kyiv in the Ukraine to protest against the decision of pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych to pull out of signing an association agreement with the European Union. Demonstrations, focused on the Maidan (also known in English as Independence Square) in the capital, spread throughout the country, and were violently suppressed. President Yanukovych fled to Russia in February 2014 as a consequence of the demonstrations, and a pro-EU government took power after new elections. ","This exacerbated tensions between the east and west of the country. In March 2014, Kremlin-backed forces occupied the Crimean peninsula. Russian is widely spoken in parts of the east of the country and in the Crimean Peninsula; with roughly 30% of Ukrainians using it as their native language, according to a Ukraine government census. The territory voted to join Russia, in a referendum that Ukraine declared unconstitutional. A month later, separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk seized government buildings and established self-proclaimed people’s republics, a status not recognized by any UN member except for Russia. Clashes between government and separatist forces resulted in heavy casualties on both sides. Russia conducted a number of military exercises near the Ukrainian border, while Ukraine and NATO officials accused Russia of arming the rebels and invading Ukraine territory, a claim Russia denied.

94,1,Evia Island Wildfire,"08 August, 2021","Panayiota Kritsiopi cries out as a wildfire approaches her house in the village of Gouves, on the island of Evia, Greece.Wildfires broke out on Evia – Greece’s largest island after Crete – in July and August, following the hottest weather Greece had experienced in 30 years. The megafire (so called because of its intensity, size, duration and uncontrolled character) raged through large forests in the north of the island, as well as rural and urban areas, and took almost two weeks to bring under control. Around 1,000 firefighters battled the blaze, with extra equipment flown in from other EU countries, Russia, the UK and the US. Some 2,500 people were evacuated by boat, and, according to the University of Athens, the fire eventually covered an expanse of more than 1,900 square kilometers, more than half the island’s area. Annual fires are a common occurrence in the Mediterranean, but stronger heatwaves led to a longer, more intense annual fire season. Devastating wildfires also took place in Turkey, Italy, Spain in 2021. While global heating is undoubtedly a factor in the fire on Evia, local reports also pointed to other contributing factors, such as rural depopulation (resulting in lack of land management), budget cuts in the fire brigade, and changes in fire management strategies. This photograph became a symbol of the impact of wildfires in Europe. Kritsiopi is quoted as saying: “At that moment I was shouting not only for myself. For the whole village.” In the end, her home remained intact.

95,1,As Frozen Land Burns,"08 July, 2021","A forest fire burns beside the road between Magaras and Berdigestyakh, in central Sakha, Siberia, Russia.Sakha, also known as Yakutia, which extends over more than three million square kilometers in the far northeast of the Russian Federation, experienced devastating wildfires, severe smoke pollution, and melting of its permafrost in 2021. The region – 40% of which lies within the Arctic Circle – is one of the coldest inhabited places on Earth, with temperatures varying from -60°C in winter to 40°C in summer, according to the Scott Polar Research Institute. The Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme reports that the Arctic is heating three times faster than the global average. In Sakha, even though fires are a natural part of the ecosystem, a mild spring followed by extremely hot and dry weather led to a record-breaking fire season in the region. By mid-August, more than 17.08 million hectares had been ravaged by fire, according to Greenpeace Russia – larger than the areas burned by fires in Greece, Turkey, Italy, the US, and Canada combined. NASA satellite imagery showed smoke from the wildfires to have traveled more than 3,000 km to the North Pole. Firefighters told Agence France-Presse they lacked the personnel and equipment to deal with the wildfires, and critics pointed to a 2015 law that allows authorities to let wildfires burn if the potential damage is considered not worth the costs of containing them. This leads to a slow response time while fires grow ever more out of control.","In addition to the fires, there are indications that higher temperatures are leading to degradation of the permafrost – soil and rocks held together by ice and containing large amounts of organic carbon from frozen plant material. As permafrost melts, this material rots, releasing carbon dioxide and methane, which can be an even more potent greenhouse gas.",2022 Photo Contest,Europe,Stories,"This story of forest fires portrays the issue in a haunting, yet poetic way.

The Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme reports that the Arctic is heating three times faster than the global average. In Sakha, even though fires are a natural part of the ecosystem, a mild spring followed by extremely hot and dry weather led to a record-breaking fire season in the region. By mid-August, more than 17.08 million hectares had been ravaged by fire, according to Greenpeace Russia – larger than the areas burned by fires in Greece, Turkey, Italy, the US, and Canada combined. NASA satellite imagery showed smoke from the wildfires to have traveled more than 3,000 km to the North Pole. Firefighters told Agence France-Presse they lacked the personnel and equipment to deal with the wildfires, and critics pointed to a 2015 law that allows authorities to let wildfires burn if the potential damage is considered not worth the costs of containing them.

105,1,Kamloops Residential School,"19 June, 2021","Red dresses hung on crosses along a roadside commemorate children who died at the Kamloops Indian Residential School, an institution created to assimilate Indigenous children, following the detection of as many as 215 unmarked graves, Kamloops, British Columbia.The hanging of red dresses as a visual response to the disproportionate violence faced by women with an Indigenous heritage began in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 2011; orange shirts are also used, specifically to acknowledge suffering caused to children by the residential school system in Canada. Residential schools began operating in the 19th century as part of a policy of assimilating people from various Indigenous communities into Western, and predominantly Christian culture. Students were removed from their homes and parents – frequently by force – and often forbidden to communicate in their own languages. Their hair was cut short, and they had to wear uniforms, rather than traditional clothing, were given Euro-Christian names in place of their own, and were subject to physical and sometimes sexual abuse. Supreme Court Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin claimed Canada used the institutions to commit cultural genocide.","Upwards of 150,000 children passed through the doors of residential schools before the last one closed in 1996. A Truth and Reconciliation Commission, set up in 2009, concluded that at least 4,100 students died while at the schools, as a result of mistreatment, neglect, disease or accident. The Kamloops School, established in 1890, became the largest in the system, attended by hundreds of Secwépemc and other First Nations children. It closed in 1978. In May 2021, a survey using ground-penetrating radar identified as many as 215 potential juvenile burial sites at Kamloops – confirming reports from oral histories.",2022 Photo Contest,World Press Photo of the Year,Kamloops Residential School,"This winner represents the awakening of a shameful history that is finally being addressed in Canada.

A main driving force of declining agrobiodiversity is the push for the cultivation of monocultures of modified and often non-native varieties, for higher-yield crops.","The video is narrated by the photographer and their father, and is informed by the father’s memory, as well as their own perceptions of the transformations experienced by small farmers over the last three generations. Romero's father migrated in 1981 in search of better opportunities and to escape the violence that Colombia was experiencing in those years.",2022 Photo Contest,World Press Photo Open Format Award,Blood is a Seed,"This is a very strong project which approaches an issue of global concern from a personal angle, by reflecting on personal loss. Through investigating her own roots and ancestry, the photographer addresses the violent and strategic erasure of cultural knowledge which continues to have deeply rooted consequences on new generations, broader society and the Earth. The combination of methods and sensory layers – sound, code design and collaborative drawings – build on a clear language that is at once personal and political. The video is well-paced and is a great example of how the Open Format category is a space where photographers can make use of several mediums in a coherent and imaginative way to forward a narrative that is of global relevance.The jury awarded this project with the World Press Photo Open Format Award because it connects the personal loss of ancestral knowledge and cultural heritage to the strategic erasure of ancient knowledge and ways of living, in a striking commentary on the consequences of global agrobiodiversity loss.",https://www.worldpressphoto.org/getmedia/7fa5135e-7571-40ff-83a7-409e12f88d6f/WPP_2022Contest_OPFA_Isadora-Romero.jpg?maxsidesize=1920&resizemode=force,F:\Temp\2022\Isadora Romero\1.jpg,Isadora Romero,2022

The protests were brutally suppressed. Reuters reported that five people were killed in the protests.The military had seized control in a coup on 25 October, after long disagreement between civilian members of an earlier transitional government and military members unwilling to share power. The military had dissolved this government, and detained its prime minister, Abdalla Hamdok. Protesters then took to the streets demanding a return to civilian government and the release of Hamdok, but were met with violence. At least seven people were killed and 140 injured in the October protests, according to reports in The New York Times. Unrest continued even after Hamdok’s reinstatement. Internet services were disrupted, and local and international broadcasting networks said that the government barred them from reporting on events. The reinstated prime minister Hamdok resigned early in January 2022 amidst continuing political deadlock.The photographer is Sudanese and lives in Khartoum.

This shift in focus was a result of mounting rural poverty and a food crisis – a situation exacerbated by a 2009 military coup, ongoing drought, and environmental degradation.

155,1,Palestinian Children in Gaza,"25 May, 2021","Palestinian children gather with candles in Beit Lahia, Gaza, Palestine, after a protest by children in the neighborhood against attacks on Gaza, during a fragile ceasefire following an 11-day conflict between Hamas and Israel.","The photographer was born and raised in Gaza, and was nine years old when the blockade of Gaza City began in 2006. She decided to tell her story in 2021, through the stories of others, as she finds it difficult to watch childhood events recurring in the present. UNICEF stated that around 500,000 children in Gaza could be in need of psychological support following the 2021 conflict.The 11-day conflict had broken out on 10 May, following rising tensions over threatened evictions in the disputed Sheikh Jarrah district in East Jerusalem, and clashes at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound – one of Islam’s holiest sites – in Jerusalem’s Old City. Hamas, the de facto governing authority in Gaza,  had set Israel an ultimatum, demanding Israel withdraw its security forces from the Al-Aqsa compound, and when the deadline passed, fired rockets on Jerusalem. Israel responded with airstrikes on Gaza. The conflict escalated, spreading to involve other cities in Israel and fire across the borders with Syria and Lebanon, in what became the heaviest outbreak of fighting since the 2014 Gaza War. According to the UN, more than 230 Palestinians were killed, including 106 women and children. The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported 13 casualties in Israel, of which 12 were civilians.

166,1,Boundaries: Human-Tiger Conflict,"15 October, 2015","A night watchman keeps watch from a tower to protect his crops from wild boar and deer, in the village of Ghosri, near the Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve, Chandrapur, Maharashtra, India. Tigers also roam the farmland at times, in search of water, prey, shelter, or marking out new territory. Around 200 tigers live in Chandrapur, of which around 80 share the space outside of the tiger reserve core zone.","In India, Bengal tigers (Panthera tigris tigris) and residents of villages in and around animal sanctuaries come into conflict. Bengal tigers are considered endangered, with up to 3,000 surviving in the wild. Human settlement, cultivation, and urban development are encroaching on tigers’ natural habitat and reducing their prey-base.India has some 500 wildlife sanctuaries, including 50 tiger reserves, with thousands of villages situated inside or around the perimeters. Villagers are often from Indigenous communities, and are dependent on their livestock, farming, or the forest for their livelihoods. Conflict arises when tigers kill livestock, either within the reserves, in pastures around the perimeters, or in important migration corridors between the reserves. A simultaneous decrease in forest cover and expansion of a tiger population may cause tigers to seek new territory. Also, old or injured tigers that are weak and unable to hunt may leave their territories, and, with no other option, frequent populated areas and prey on livestock or humans. Purposeful attacks on humans are rare, and usually occur when angry groups surround tigers who have entered settlements. When villagers continually lose their livestock, they may poison tigers – a measure illegal under Indian conservation laws. Forest officials occasionally shoot tigers when they see that as the only practical solution in situations threatening human life.The Indian government is attempting to mitigate human-tiger conflict in a number of ways, including capture and relocation of problem tigers (which is often difficult to do, and can simply transfer the conflict to a new situation); employing human herders to guard livestock, payment of compensation to victims, and the relocation of human settlements. Although consolidating tiger habitats by moving humans has helped wild tiger populations recover, it can lead to human hardship and resentment if not carried out in a way that is transparent, incentive-driven and fair. Some people see relocation as eviction from their place of origin, and have protested at what they consider a violation of their community rights.The photographer was born and raised in southern India, and has been working with conservationists, forest officials, and local villagers for the past ten years, to understand and document the various dimensions of human-tiger conflict.",2022 Photo Contest,Asia,Long-Term Projects,"This project is highly relevant for a region where so many people are living in rural villages, and skillfully portrays both human and tiger worlds. The photographer poses the challenge of tigers affecting human communities, as a symptom to a larger issue of global environmental change. While we can accept that the problem is essentially created by humans, the project shows great empathy for both sides of the struggle. Even more, there is an equally important third perspective of conservationists and forest guards who inhabit a role of trying to balance both human and nonhuman interests. The visual language of loose, blurry frames conveys movement and the urgency of survival for both humans and tigers in the wake of regional environmental change. The consistently well edited and sequenced work effectively communicates this complex challenge.",https://www.worldpressphoto.org/getmedia/6fe039cd-0c60-4794-bc73-afc87931534e/WPP_2022Contest_Asia_LTP_Senthil-Kumaran_AAD.jpg?maxsidesize=1920&resizemode=force,F:\Temp\2022\Senthil Kumaran\1.jpg,Senthil Kumaran,2022

President Muhammadu Buhari has stated that more than 12 million children, girls in particular, are currently traumatized and fear going to school. This can contribute to many girls being taken out of school to work, or forced into marriage, according to Human Rights Watch. UNICEF reports that Nigeria has the highest rate of child marriage in West Africa, with 22 million women and girls married before the age of 18.The first mass school abduction in Nigeria took place in April 2014, when members of the Islamic extremist group Boko Haram kidnapped more than 200 girls from a government boarding school in Chibok, Borno State, in the northeast of the country. A Bring Back Our Girls global campaign led to international protests and contributed to wider discussions about girls’ and women’s access to education. Kidnappings have continued and now extend to boys, too, yet have largely fallen from international media attention. Boko Haram as well as other jihadist groups kidnap students to oppose Western secularism; other gangs do so in the hope of gaining quick cash through ransoms. Hostages have also been used to bargain for the release of imprisoned Boko Haram members.The photographer has witnessed a relative navigate the trauma of kidnapping in Nigeria.
