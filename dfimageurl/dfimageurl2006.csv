On average a child laborer gets 60 taka (less than US$ 1) a day, about one third of the adult rate.

The bomber blew himself up on a train at the station, killing seven passengers—one of four coordinated attacks on London's public transport system during the morning rush hour. The bombs exploded within 50 seconds of each other on London Underground trains, and the fourth bomb occurred on a bus less than an hour later.
The explosions resulted in some 56 deaths (including those of the four bombers) and 700 injuries. Surveillance video footage showed that the four men had been working together, but the motivation for the bombings remains unclear. Some believe the attacks had been planned by Islamist paramilitary organizations based in the United Kingdom. Intelligence services have claimed links between the bombers and al-Qaeda.",3rd prize,Edmond Terakopian,2006

Soldiers opened fire after the car driven by Samar's father failed to stop as it approached their dusk patrol. A US military statement said troops trying to halt the car used hand signals and fired warning shots before firing directly at the car, killing the driver and front-seat passenger. The town had only days before been the scene of a gun battle between US forces and local insurgents. As a defense against car bombs in many cities in Iraq, it had become standard practice for foot patrols to stop oncoming vehicles, particularly after dark. Five of Samar's siblings were in the car with her. All six survived, although her brother Racan was seriously wounded.
