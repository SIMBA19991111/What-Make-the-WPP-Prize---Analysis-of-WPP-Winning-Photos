0,1,The Dying River,"11 March, 2022","Alfredo, Ubaldo, and José tend beehives near Wenden in the Arizona desert, United States. A substantial decrease in rainfall in the area means that the men must now provide water for the bees in troughs.","Heat and drought weakens bees, making them more susceptible to pathogens and parasites, and impacts the plants from which they feed. Between 2019 and 2020, colonies of managed honey-bees declined by 43.7% across the US. Bees are vital for pollinating many crops, and so play an important role in food security for humans.",2023 Photo Contest,North and Central America,Singles,"This portrait of beekeepers is visually clean and sparks interest and curiosity to understand the issue at hand. The image is subtle and understated, and the jury was impressed by the composition of bees across all thirds. While the topic resonates at a global level, the image itself encourages us to sit with these particular people and consider how they might be impacted by the ongoing environmental crisis.",https://www.worldpressphoto.org/getmedia/6f288c3f-dc33-4131-856f-aab3801625d1/WPP-2023Contest-North-and-Central-America-SIN-Jonas-Kako.jpg?maxsidesize=1920&resizemode=force,F:\Temp\2023\Jonas Kakó\1.jpg,Jonas Kakó,2023

The authorities deported Maria, but her children remained behind. US officials at first arranged for the girls to stay in a children’s shelter; later, they went to live with Maria’s adult son, who was already in the country. ",2023 Photo Contest,North and Central America,Stories,"This project answers many questions about the outcome of one's journey of displacement.

The story offers a unique, emotional perspective on migration that is different from mainstreamed stories.

52,1,Shifting,Valentina is a 13-year-old who aspires to become a photographer and whose mother is in prison for marijuana possession.,"In Latin America, the incarceration of women has increased dramatically over the last two decades. More than half of the women imprisoned in Ecuador have been charged with drug related crimes and the vast majority of these are for micro-trafficking, the sale of minimal amounts of drugs. The adoption of increasingly punitive laws as a part of the war on drugs and the ongoing prison crisis in the country means that women prisoners are disproportionately impacted and especially vulnerable to prison violence, abuse, and neglect. ","Valentina is a 13-year-old who aspires to become a photographer and whose mother is in prison for marijuana possession. Ecuador’s pre-trial detention policy and punitive sentencing policy means that the separation between mothers and their children has been especially harrowing and increasingly common.

85,1,"Woman, Life, Freedom",This photo-based video offers a rare and personal glimpse into the dangers faced by protestors on the streets of Iran today.,"On 16 September 2022, Mahsa “Jina” Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman, died after she was arrested by the Islamic Republic’s morality police for allegedly violating the country’s strict rules restricting the dress and conduct of women. The protests, which began in Amini’s hometown of Saqez, quickly intensified, spreading across the country with support from Iranians of all ages, genders, and ethnicities. The Islamic Republic responded by disrupting internet access, intimidating journalists, and violently repressing uprisings with state security forces. Because hospitals are controlled by the regime, anyone injured in the protest risks arrest and further abuse upon seeking medical attention. ","This photo-based video project narrates one chaotic night in the life of an Iranian nurse as she fights to save the life of a young man named Reza, who is badly wounded by crossfire at a protest. Reza is dying and needs immediate medical attention, but the nurse fears that if he is taken to a hospital he will be arrested rather than given medical care. Instead, at great risk to herself, she takes him home and gives him a blood transfusion from her own body, saving his life. ",2023 Photo Contest,Asia,Open Format,"The jury was interested in this unique angle of widespread protests in Iran. The successful combination of photography, narrative audio, and video provides thorough information from the perspective of a nurse. The photographer successfully collected the visuals in a highly authoritarian context where gaining access to these stories is increasingly difficult. The project managed to connect with the jury on both a micro and macro level by recording the personal thoughts and emotions of the nurse while also communicating the bigger picture of the fight for women's freedoms in Iran. ",https://www.worldpressphoto.org/getmedia/0c302d22-d60e-4388-81c3-150f77a712b0/WPP-2023Contest-Asia-OPF-Hossein-Fatemi.jpg?maxsidesize=1920&resizemode=force,F:\Temp\2023\Anonymous\1.jpg,Anonymous,2023

Ukrainian authorities reported five people killed and a further 15 wounded in the city that day.","Russian forces began advancing towards Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, as soon as their full-scale invasion began on 24 February. Russia may have regarded Kharkiv, some 35 kilometers from the border, as an easy target due to its large number of Russian-speaking inhabitants; instead Russian forces were met with fierce resistance. Throughout March and April, the city was partially encircled and remained under heavy shelling. In May, Ukraine forced a Russian withdrawal from the immediate surroundings of Kharkiv, although much of provincial Kharkiv remained under Russian control throughout the summer, and shelling frequently reached the city. By 14 September, Ukrainian forces had regained control of the province. ",2023 Photo Contest,Europe,Singles,"This is a visually simple photo that highlights the reality of daily life in Ukraine and the thin line between life and death that civilians walk everyday. Taken in a sensitive moment, the image is loaded with grief and heartbreak, and boldly accomplishes the directness that the jury was looking for in a single image. The soft quality of colors creates a sense of quiet amidst the very loud pain.

106,1,Shireen Abu Akleh’s Funeral,"13 May, 2022","Israeli police beat mourners accompanying the coffin of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh to her funeral, in East Jerusalem. Police prohibited people from carrying the coffin on foot through the city, which is customary for notable deaths, as mourners chanted “We sacrifice our soul and blood for you, Shireen”.Shireen Abu Akleh, a veteran reporter of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, was shot two days earlier while covering an Israeli military raid in Jenin, West Bank. She was wearing a helmet and a blue vest labeled “PRESS” at the time. Another journalist at the scene, Al Jazeera producer Ali al-Samoudi, was wounded by a bullet in the back. He said that no Palestinian fighters were present when they were shot, and that journalists were not warned or asked to leave. International media and organizations such as Bellingcat, Forensic Architecture, and The Washington Post investigated and corroborated the claims. ","A Palestinian investigation concluded Abu Akleh had been intentionally targeted. After initially rejecting these allegations, the Israeli military has since admitted there was a “high possibility” Abu Akleh was shot by an Israeli soldier, but denies deliberate targeting. Both the US Department of Justice and the International Criminal Court have launched investigations into the shooting.Reporters Sans Frontières says that 55 journalists and four media workers were killed worldwide in 2022 for reasons linked to their activities. ",2023 Photo Contest,Asia,Singles,"This image represents multiple aspects of the ongoing occupation of Palestine– the lack of press freedom and the inability for Palestinians to lay their dead to rest and mourn. In this image, one can hear and feel a chaos frozen in time, while the composition helps to convey the brutal hardline of security forces disrupting Abu Akleh's funeral procession. For the jury, the image serves as an emotional reminder of the continued fight for press freedom and a world where journalists are noncombatants who should be able to depict truth.",https://www.worldpressphoto.org/getmedia/92efea27-edc2-4ee0-afb0-9251657dfdb0/WPP-2023Contest-Asia-SIN-Maya-Levin.jpg?maxsidesize=1920&resizemode=force,F:\Temp\2023\Maya Levin\1.jpg,Maya Levin,2023

127,1,The Big Forget,"27 October, 2022","Sugri Zenabu, a mangazia (female community leader) of the Gambaga “witch camp”, sits encircled by residents in Gambaga, Ghana. Zenabu shows some signs of confusion and memory loss associated with dementia.This photograph is part of a personal project aimed at drawing attention to often overlooked stories about dementia from the African continent. As life expectancy rises, dementia is increasingly becoming a public health and socio-cultural issue in Africa. Numbers of people living with dementia in sub-Saharan Africa are projected to double every 20 years. While key policy makers highlight trends in dementia care, treatment, and prevention, less attention is given to cultural perceptions of the condition.","People who hold traditional beliefs in Ghana and across sub-Saharan Africa sometimes see dementia symptoms such as confused speech, uncontrolled swearing, and disoriented wandering as signs of sorcery. Women are accused of being witches more frequently than men. In Ghana, they may flee or be sent away to live in so-called “witch camps”. The camps are controversial. On the one hand, they offer refuge and protection from violence; on the other, residents are stigmatized, and open to exploitation by local chiefs, who earn money from trials and rituals associated with witchcraft. Nurses from local communities who are sensitive to traditional beliefs, can play a bridging role in education about dementia, and so in reducing discrimination and stigmatization. ",2023 Photo Contest,Africa,Singles,"The photographer tackles a global public health issue that is usually hidden across Africa. The jury identified the photo’s high visual quality and use of symbols to reflect on people’s experiences of dementia and other age-related illnesses. The image captures an experience that mostly takes place in the unseen world of people's minds, in a clever, figurative way. The image successfully represents both memory loss and the tournstyle of people who pass through the camp while also centering the role of the female leader. The photographer achieves this while also avoiding the reinforcement of harmful stereotypes.",https://www.worldpressphoto.org/getmedia/ab29df67-931f-4308-8cf5-00b7df73a41f/WPP-2023Contest-Africa-SIN-Lee-Ann-Olwage.jpg?maxsidesize=1920&resizemode=force,F:\Temp\2023\Lee-AnnOlwage\1.jpg,Lee-AnnOlwage,2023
128,1,"Here, The Doors Don't Know Me","Using found imagery and the artist’s own photography, Mohamed Mahdy’s project presents an elegy to a communal way of life on the cusp of disappearing.For generations, the residents of Al Max, a fishing community in Alexandria, Egypt, have lived close to the water. They built their homes right along the Mahmoudiyah canal, which connected their fishing boats to the Mediterranean. Life on the waters of the canal may have appeared idyllic, especially to photographers like Mohamed Mahdy, who was initially drawn to the site for its atmosphere, but making a living fishing at Al Max has always been difficult. International environmental agreements restrict the number of days residents can fish. Pollution from surrounding factories force fishermen to sail farther out to sea on small wooden boats, which endangers their boats and their lives. Despite the challenges, the people here have formed a strong and unique community and culture.","In 2020, the Egyptian government began evicting parts of Al Max and relocating people to housing several kilometers away from the canals. So far, about a third of the neighborhood of Al Max has been relocated. The government cites rising sea levels due to global climate change and a need for urban renewal and development as reasons for relocation, but many residents remain skeptical of its necessity. What is certain is that relocation means not only demolishing homes, but endangering the collective memories and local culture embedded in the neighborhood of Al Max. The stories captured by this project speak to the precarity of people everywhere striving for recognition amid global economic and environmental upheaval. ","People of the Al Max community speak of love letters or last words found in bottles that would wash on to their shores. For this project, Mohamed Mahdy encouraged residents to write their own letters, building an archive of private memories for future generations. Visitors to the website are also encouraged to send their letters to the residents of Al Max, opening a channel of communication to the outside world.Experience the interactive website.",2023 Photo Contest,World Press Photo Open Format Award,Here,"This web-based photo project stood out for taking advantage of the range of available tools to tell a unique story about a community of fisher folk in Alexandria.

When Russian forces invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022, they immediately targeted the strategically important port of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov. Russian shelling devastated the city, including numerous civilian targets, such as the maternity hospital photographed here. ","At first, Russia labeled reports of the attack on the hospital, which resulted in three deaths and some 17 injuries, as fake news. Later, the Russian foreign affairs minister Sergey Lavrov said it had been deliberate, claiming the hospital had been taken over by paramilitaries, and that patients and staff had been evacuated.

169,1,"Here, The Doors Don't Know Me","Using found imagery and the artist’s own photography, Mohamed Mahdy’s project presents an elegy to a communal way of life on the cusp of disappearing. For generations, the residents of Al Max, a fishing community in Alexandria, Egypt, have lived close to the water. They built their homes right along the Mahmoudiyah canal, which connected their fishing boats to the Mediterranean. Life on the waters of the canal may have appeared idyllic, especially to photographers like Mohamed Mahdy, who was initially drawn to the site for its atmosphere, but making a living fishing at Al Max has always been difficult. International environmental agreements restrict the number of days residents can fish. Pollution from surrounding factories force fishermen to sail farther out to sea on small wooden boats, which endangers their boats and their lives. Despite the challenges, the people here have formed a strong and unique community and culture.","In 2020, the Egyptian government began evicting parts of Al Max and relocating people to housing several kilometers away from the canals. So far, about a third of the neighborhood of Al Max has been relocated. The government cites rising sea levels due to global climate change and a need for urban renewal and development as reasons for relocation, but many residents remain skeptical of its necessity. What is certain is that relocation means not only demolishing homes, but endangering the collective memories and local culture embedded in the neighborhood of Al Max. The stories captured by this project speak to the precarity of people everywhere striving for recognition amid global economic and environmental upheaval. ","People of the Al Max community speak of love letters or last words found in bottles that would wash on to their shores. For this project, Mohamed Mahdy encouraged residents to write their own letters, building an archive of private memories for future generations. Visitors to the website are also encouraged to send their letters to the residents of Al Max, opening a channel of communication to the outside world. Experience the interactive website.Are you a photographer and",2023 Photo Contest,Africa,Open Format ,"This web-based photo project stood out for taking advantage of the range of available tools to tell a unique story about a community of fisher folk in Alexandria.
