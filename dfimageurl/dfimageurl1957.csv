In 1999, photographer Simon E. Smit told De Zilveren Camera, on the occasion of its 50th anniversary, about making the image: 'I was walking on the Veenkade in The Hague, when a man asked me for directions. I told him how to walk and watched him go, when I discovered, seeing his cane and bag, that he was blind. Shortly afterwards, I heard cries for help and a lot of clamor and screaming. Apparently the man had walked straight into the water. As I always carry a camera with me, I could immortalize how this blind man was rescued from the water at the Veenkade.'",2nd prize,Simon E.
