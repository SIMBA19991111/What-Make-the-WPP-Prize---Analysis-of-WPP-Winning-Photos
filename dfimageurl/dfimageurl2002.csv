The children are often the first to die, and their thoughts and feelings hardly count. I hope that people will recognize them in my photos.'

Aleksander Nordahl: 'I took this picture a few weeks after 11 September 2001, at a time when world attention was focused on Afghanistan. The reporter and I concentrated mostly on daily life and behind the front stories, and on the terrible humanitarian situation. The most important stories for me, in Afghanistan and elsewhere, are those about children in situations of war and disaster. The children are often the first to die, and their thoughts and feelings hardly count. I hope that people will recognize them in my photos.'
