The deadly virus, for which there was no cure, infects the lungs and is spread easily by person-to-person contact.

By May more than 4,800 cases had been reported in at least 26 countries, with over 300 fatalities. As it was so easily transmittable, Sars caused widespread public concern, resulting in impositions of quarantine, and plummeting tourist and airline figures.",3rd prize,Qiu Yan,2004
