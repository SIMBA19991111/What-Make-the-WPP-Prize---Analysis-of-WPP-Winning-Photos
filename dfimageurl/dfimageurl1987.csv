Three years later, the wall came down.

Roland Holschneider: 'When I arrived at Friedrichstrasse on 13 August 1986, demonstrators were taunting police at Checkpoint Charlie. The white line indicates the frontier between East and West. I took one step across the line, which would normally be dangerous, but the policemen were busy controlling the demonstrators. Then the man on the left kicked the policeman’s backside. My picture, symbolizing the crazy situation in Berlin, was widely published in Germany and abroad.'

In May 1986, the civil war in Sri Lanka escalated with several bomb attacks on civilian targets. These attacks were blamed on the Tamil Tigers, guerrillas of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the most radical of the insurgent factions fighting for an independent Tamil state in northern and eastern Sri Lanka. The Tamil rebels, who are mainly Hindu, believed that the government intended to increase the number of mainly Buddhist Sinhalese, the major ethnic group in Sri Lanka, in areas that are predominantly Tamil. 

Established as a tightly organised insurgent group in the 1970s, the Tamil Tigers were in control of most of the Jaffna peninsula in northern Sri Lanka by 1985. Large-scale violence had erupted between the Sinhalese government and the Tamil guerrillas in the early 1980s. Fighting continued on and off until February 2002, when the government and the Tamil Tigers signed a permanent cease-fire agreement, which was soon violated by both sides. After a military campaign of 26 years, the Tamil Tigers were defeated in May 2009 by the government troops, which brought the civil war to an end.",3rd prize,James Nachtwey,1987
