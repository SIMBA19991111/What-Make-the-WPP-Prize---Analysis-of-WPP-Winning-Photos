Salvador Allende had won the presidential elections in Chile in 1970, becoming the country’s first democratically chosen socialist president. After his election, Allende began to structure Chilean society along socialist lines, expropriating US-owned copper mines and nationalizing other industries and agricultural estates. His attempt to redistribute incomes led to an economic decline with stagnant productions, decreased exports, widespread strikes, and a rising inflation, creating social unrest. Although he kept the support of many workers and peasants, Allende’s government was overthrown on 11 September 1973 by a military coup, led by Augusto Pinochet and backed by the CIA. While La Moneda palace was bombed, President Allende gave a brief farewell speech on live radio refusing to leave the palace. Not long after, he shot himself.",1st prize,Orlando Lagos,1974

The photo series shows how North Vietnamese prisoners of war are being released and exchanged with South Vietnamese prisoners of war on the other side of the river. Both had to cross the river, in order to reach their comrades on the other side of the river. Friedmann ran with the released prisoners through the water, photographing them, while his colleagues stayed on the river bank to photograph the scene. This approach earned him the World Press Photo award, but also gave him a life-threatening bacterial infection. 

The release of prisoners of war was settled in the Paris Peace Accords, which were signed on 27 January 1973 by the United States, the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam). The settlement included a cease-fire throughout Vietnam. Furthermore, the United States agreed to withdraw all US troops and advisors, including the dismantling of all US bases within 60 days. In return, the North-Vietnamese agreed to release all US and other prisoners of war.
