The promise of freedom and prosperity coupled with the desperate situation at home caused tens of thousands of Cubans to take to the sea in an attempt to reach Florida, 150km across the water. When Fidel Castro lifted Cuba's tight travel restrictions in August the exodus reached a peak, with some 2,000 departures a day. Using hastily built, rickety vessels, countless refugees drowned in the shark-infested seas. The influx of Cubans into the US became a major problem for President Clinton. In early September he authorized direct talks to be held in New York, which resulted in an agreement designed to stem the tide of refugees.",1st prize,Garo Lachinian,1995

They belong to the Lakotas, native Americans in South Dakota, USA.

The defeat at the Battle of Wounded Knee in 1890 spelled the end of the freedom of the Lakota, when the US cavalry killed 200 of them. Self-determination and the recovery of the Black Hills territory are the goals the Lakota have set themselves. They believe they are the Seventh Generation, who according to a prophesy by holy man Black Elk will recover the power lost when their land was conquered. The need to reconcile spiritual wealth and material poverty, dreams and the harsh realities of everyday life, characterizes their existence. Numbering some 20,000, today's Lakota live in the Pine Ridge Reservation.

Katrin Freisager: 'My aim was to produce images which did not reflect the romantic cliché we Europeans have of native Americans. I portrayed many ordinary young people, and talked with them about their future and their dreams. I wanted to find out where the new generation of Lakotas stands today and what conditions they face in the Pine Ridge Reservation, a poverty-stricken area in the heart of the affluent USA. Das Magazin made it possible for me to work on this story. I returned to South Dakota for three consecutive years to shoot material for a book about young Lakotas.'

They belong to the Lakotas, native Americans in South Dakota, USA.

The defeat at the Battle of Wounded Knee in 1890 spelled the end of the freedom of the Lakota, when the US cavalry killed 200 of them. Self-determination and the recovery of the Black Hills territory are the goals the Lakota have set themselves. They believe they are the Seventh Generation, who according to a prophesy by holy man Black Elk will recover the power lost when their land was conquered. The need to reconcile spiritual wealth and material poverty, dreams and the harsh realities of everyday life, characterizes their existence. Numbering some 20,000, today's Lakota live in the Pine Ridge Reservation.

Katrin Freisager: 'My aim was to produce images which did not reflect the romantic cliché we Europeans have of native Americans. I portrayed many ordinary young people, and talked with them about their future and their dreams. I wanted to find out where the new generation of Lakotas stands today and what conditions they face in the Pine Ridge Reservation, a poverty-stricken area in the heart of the affluent USA. Das Magazin made it possible for me to work on this story. I returned to South Dakota for three consecutive years to shoot material for a book about young Lakotas.'

Self-determination and the recovery of the Black Hills territory are the goals the Lakota have set themselves. They believe they are the Seventh Generation, who according to a prophesy by holy man Black Elk will recover the power lost when their land was conquered. The need to reconcile spiritual wealth and material poverty, dreams and the harsh realities of everyday life, characterizes their existence.

Katrin Freisager: 'My aim was to produce images which did not reflect the romantic cliché we Europeans have of native Americans. I portrayed many ordinary young people, and talked with them about their future and their dreams. I wanted to find out where the new generation of Lakotas stands today and what conditions they face in the Pine Ridge Reservation, a poverty-stricken area in the heart of the affluent USA. Das Magazin made it possible for me to work on this story. I returned to South Dakota for three consecutive years to shoot material for a book about young Lakotas.'
