In 1966, Romania's president Nicolae Ceausescu had issued a decree, banning birth control and declaring abortion illegal for any woman younger than 45 who had not yet produced four children. His aim was to expand industrialization by expanding Romania's workforce, but his harsh economic measures forced many parents to abandon their children as they could not support them.
After the 1989 revolution and the subsequent execution of Ceausescu and his wife, the legacy of his decree became painfully visible to the rest of world.

In downtown Johannesburg the shocking ‘Whites Only’ signs had gone, and Nelson Mandela’s release was imminent. The challenge was to document the subtle changes that were taking place. Noticing these blacks and whites waiting together for a bus, I parked my car, grabbed my camera and took the picture. They sat frozen, displaying a universal body language that can be read by children of all ages and nationalities.'

They sat frozen, displaying a universal body language that can be read by children of all ages and nationalities.'

Since 1974, Kosovo had been an autonomous province within Serbia and Yugoslavia. In 1989, Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian leader, reduced Kosovo’s autonomous status and started a policy of cultural oppression of the ethnic Albanian population. At the end of January 1990, unarmed ethnic Albanians in Kosovo clashed with Serbian armed troops. Serb police reinforcements were sent to the province to aid federal troops already stationed in Kosovo. The episode would form an overture to the Kosovo War of 1998-1999.",1st prize,Georges Mérillon,1991
