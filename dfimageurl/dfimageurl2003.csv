Twenty years of conflict have ravaged the country and made everyday life difficult, especially in Kabul and the densely populated south. Winter brought further difficulties to an already destitute population. Aid organizations implemented programs to help with reconstruction of the country, including rehabilitating the water supply and providing blankets, winter fuel and plastic sheeting.

Patrick Andrade: 'Residents of Kabul were lining up to receive their rations of charcoal and other aid â€“ a cold and extremely dusty scene that left a black mask on everyone's face. Among the adults arguing over their place in line was a group of children who waited around the supply truck to dart in when pieces of coal fell from the bags as they were being unloaded. Two of the boys had found a place beneath the truck, out of sight, where they could sift through the sand without being confronted. Scared and choking from the dust, they filled their bags with scraps of charcoal for themselves and their families.'

But in recent years hunting for bushmeat has accelerated beyond sustainable levels, as demand from cities and logging settlements has grown.

Twenty years of conflict have ravaged the country and made everyday life difficult, especially in Kabul and the densely populated south. Winter brought further difficulties to an already destitute population. Aid organizations implemented programs to help with reconstruction of the country, including rehabilitating the water supply and providing blankets, winter fuel and plastic sheeting.

Patrick Andrade: 'Residents of Kabul were lining up to receive their rations of charcoal and other aid â€“ a cold and extremely dusty scene that left a black mask on everyone's face. Among the adults arguing over their place in line was a group of children who waited around the supply truck to dart in when pieces of coal fell from the bags as they were being unloaded. Two of the boys had found a place beneath the truck, out of sight, where they could sift through the sand without being confronted. Scared and choking from the dust, they filled their bags with scraps of charcoal for themselves and their families.'

The Prestige was towed out to sea after both Spanish and Portuguese governments refused permission for the ship to enter their ports. At first, oil spillage was minimal, as most compartments remained intact. But six days later the tanker broke in half, its bow and stern sinking within hours of each other and releasing an oil slick nearly 200m wide and 30km long. The slick washed ashore within days, damaging a coast that was not only rich in wildlife, but along which whole communities depended on fishing for their livelihoods.

Twenty years of conflict have ravaged the country and made everyday life difficult, especially in Kabul and the densely populated south. Winter brought further difficulties to an already destitute population. Aid organizations implemented programs to help with reconstruction of the country, including rehabilitating the water supply and providing blankets, winter fuel and plastic sheeting.

Patrick Andrade: 'Residents of Kabul were lining up to receive their rations of charcoal and other aid â€“ a cold and extremely dusty scene that left a black mask on everyone's face. Among the adults arguing over their place in line was a group of children who waited around the supply truck to dart in when pieces of coal fell from the bags as they were being unloaded. Two of the boys had found a place beneath the truck, out of sight, where they could sift through the sand without being confronted. Scared and choking from the dust, they filled their bags with scraps of charcoal for themselves and their families.'

It is being held by the model herself, and was made by the British firm Hybrid Enterprises. She sat immobile for 40 minutes while technicians painted silicone material on to her face, then covered it in plaster to make a mold. A second, flexible, mold was made over this cast. The two surfaces were separated and liquid, flesh-toned silicone injected between them. Peeling away the flexible mold revealed the final mask. False hair was applied using hypodermic syringes. This technology is primarily used to create prosthetics for the film industry, but is also being considered for medical applications.",2nd prize,Sarah Leen,2003
