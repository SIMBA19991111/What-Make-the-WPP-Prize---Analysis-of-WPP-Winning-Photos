                        delivered impressive pictures, but also told stories that were real and soul-shaking.

                    </h6>

                    <p style="margin-top: 40px;">At its first launch in 1955, 42 photographers from 11 countries submitted just over 300 photographs to WPP.
                        Just in the following year, the number of participants had already quadrupled, 
                        and the number of nationalities had doubled. After nearly 
                        seven decades of growth, as the number of entries had grown tremendously to <a1>60,000</a1>, 
                        submitted by <a1>3,752</a1> photographers from <a1>127</a1> countries in 2023, WPP has long been one of the 
                        world's most important and influential photojournalism competitions, with many of the 
                        most renowned news photographs in the history as WPP's Photo of the Year. <br><br> These WPP-wining 
                        works hold a shared legacy of both documented events and photojournalism, while WPP has 
                        also played a crucial role in their recognition and dissemination. With its far-reaching influence, 
                        WPP can be able to impact the creation and documentation of photojournalism worldwide through its tastes, 
                        ultimately shaping the evolution of the field.

                        <h6>The first award-winning photograph in the history of WPP ,1955 ,by MOGENS VON HAVEN
                        </h6>
                        <p style="margin-top: 50px;">Outside the light of its professional influence, 
                            doubts and criticisms were continuous as well. 
                            Some argue that WPP's photo selection has become 
                            monotonous and lacking in creativity, with a growing 
                            tendency towards stereotypical choices, 
                            which can be exemplified by their overreliance on black 
                            and white photography, viewed as indicative of this foundation's 
                            increasingly predictable artistic taste. Additionally, 
                            one of the most common criticisms indicates repetitive keywords like <a1>"protest"</a1> and <a1>"conflict"</a1>
                             among numerous news topics, leading some to compare it to an award-winning "shortcut". 
                             <br><br>More to that, the most serious accusation concerns racial diversity: 
                             in 2021, only 7% of participants came from South America, 5% from Southeast Asia and Oceania,
                              and just 3% from Africa. Despite this lack of 
                              representation among participants, countless award-winning 
                              works are still shot year by year in these regions, whose initiative
                               to tell own stories seem to be missing from their hands.

                        </p>  
                        <p style="margin-top: 40px;">
                            As the leading authority in photojournalism, WPP has already been highly regarded by photographers worldwide. However, these kinds of skeptical voices have doubtlessly cast shadow on its reputation. <br><br><a1>The question remains:</a1><br>

                <p style="margin-top: 30px;">We kick off with appetizer, 
                    the basic element of photos: color.<br><br> 
                    The first color photographic technique has long been invented by Maxwell 
                    from England in the middle of 19th century, 
                    and the portable and practical color photography 
                    technology has been invented by Kodak and Polaroid in 1930s as well. 
                    With modern thinking, it's easy to think that color 
                    photography should have been the norm since then.<br><br> 
                    Yet on the very contrary to today’s common custom, 
                    it was long considered frivolous and vulgar at its first emergence from 1950s, 
                    and was not seen as a formal medium for serious photographers, but rather 
                    more used by their more advertisers and commercial peers. 
                    It can be indicated by quote from famous 
                    photographer Walker Evans:<br><br></p>

                    <p>
                    <br><br>As for the representative of the general view of press photographers, WPP, its tendency regarding this issue was also unapologetic: <br><br>it wasn't until 1965, its 10th year, that the <a1>first color photo</a1> finally appeared in WPP.

                        and its participants is public and long-term. For an instance, 
                        a category was established specifically for color pictures, 
                        for 9 times out of 68, meaning that color 
                        photos are more likely to be subject to 
                        inconsistent review standards compared with other 
                        photos in these years, thus affecting their 
                        chances of winning other prizes.<br><br> 
                        For a more explicit interpretation, 
                        we extracted the <a1>5 most dominant colors</a1> 
                        of every WPP wining picture since the appearance of 
                        color photo award, only to explicitly found that, 
                        even till this very year, long after the digitalized technology outburst,
                            a great number of photos are still featuring black and white, 
                            with an annual-steady proportion.

                            atmosphere creation, detail enhancement, 
                            and contrast accentuation, preference for black and white photos 
                            is common within photographers’ world, so photojournalists and their 
                            representatives at WPP are naturally not exempt from it.<br><br> 
                            That being said, after the legendary and historic color 
                            photographic exhibition of William Eggleston’s works held in 1976, 
                            the importance of color in the storytelling and artistic expression 
                            of photography had gradually been acknowledged within the photographic 
                            community, especially for the emotional expression value of certain colors.<br><br> 
                            Specifically, for WPP, looking back again at our extracted color palettes, 
                            we can also spot certain amount of colorfulness, especially represented by 
                            warmer orange and cooler blue. These award-winning photographs of color 
                            expression in warm and cool tones are, without exception, textbook-level 
                            demonstrations of the use of color in photography: <a1>use warmer color for a more 
                            passionate emotional release, and cooler color for a calmer narrative style.</a1> 
                            It can be established that even in news photography that demands a higher 
                            requirement for documentary, the good use of color emotions is also a major 
                            bonus point for photos.

            <p>That said, the longevity of color preferences can still 
                reflect a dangerous bias that has long been warned about 
                in WPP and the photojournalism community, as long 
                been indicated, quote “Media impoverishment of aesthetic 
                criteria and the conceptual contempt for the image as a form 
                of thought”.In short, even with the latest digital technology, 
                photojournalism is still facing the bottlenecks of 
                creativity, which has been recognized by WPP, who 
                had been embracing an increasingly open attitude 
                towards new forms of media works, and even recently 
                introduced a new category ‘Open Format’ from 2022 for 
                specific promotion. In spite of rising debates towards 
                this trend, WPP's proactive approach itself to media boundary 
                exploration still won wide approval.

            <p style="margin-top:30px;">Apart from its superficial artistry like color, 
                as mentioned at the beginning, photography was initially 
                invented to capture and preserve, in the form of intuitive 
                visual impact, those precious moments in history that words alone 
                cannot fully convey. Through decades, as the well-recognized pioneer 
                and beacon of photojournalism, WPP contributed to countless 
                historic photographic coverages of events that shaped our world,

                referred to being a bit homogeneous in many eyes. 
                Voices of controversy have never ceased, 
                expressing frustration and aesthetic fatigue of endless
                 ‘conflict’ and ‘protest’ main themes of WPP’s choices 
                 of award, claiming that each year’s wining 
                 photos are almost never-ending relevant to these kinds 
                 of keywords while many other important issue topics are being 
                 ignored. To make matters worse, there are more and more unsavory 
                 speculations accusing that WPP’s this kind of favor might 
                 encourage photographers to chase or deliberately amplify the
                  conflict, in exchange of attention and recognition for themselves.

            <p>To find out with an illustrative example, 
                with the help of AI sequential models,

                        it is able to conclude that in its 68-year history, 
                        ‘protest’-related works accounted for 47 years as 69% of the total. 
                        <br><br>Especially since 1981, at least one work notably mentioning 
                        protest has been produced each year. This kind of sustained attention to

                        is highly unique in WPP's history in terms of recurring themes, 
                        which explicitly demonstrates its value.<br><br>However, it is still unclear

                        Protest, along with conflict and war, is 
                        long recognized as one of the eternal themes 
                        within human societies, which is always the most direct manifestation 
                        of social contradictions at the peak of relevant regions. 
                        Arrogant aesthetic fatigue from a condescending bystander 
                        will foster indifference towards civilians who suffer in conflicts 
                        in person and undermine their right to attention. Thus, continuous 
                        attention and exposure to such issues should of course be of great 
                        importance without doubt. <br><br><a1>However, during our exploration, 
                        we have identified a long-standing flaw in the WPP 
                        and the whole photojournalism.</a1> Often, these types of 
                        controversial events are presented from incomplete perspectives,

                         on the very contrary to news professionalism. 
                         <br><br>We hope that WPP will adopt a more comprehensive 
                         and unbiased journalistic approach through these works, 
                         particularly when dealing with intricate and contentious 
                         topics, which entails, instead of mere attention-grabbing 
                         visuals, considering all relevant aspects of the issue at hand.

                             and recognition through their participation in WPP, 
                             which once again demonstrates its unshakeable recognition.

                            Among those who won the most WPP awards, all 
                            of the award-winning photographers are white and 
                            most of them from western countries such as the United 
                            States and the Netherlands. We’ve come to one of the fiercest 
                            controversies regarding WPP: even under the impression of 
                            its global status and recognition, 
                            it has never been this hard to ignore the fact that it is an 
                            institution mainly located in Netherlands, one of the most traditionally 
                            recognized European countries as there are.
                            <br><br>To further explore this problem, 
                            we have compiled the distribution of the 
                            nationalities of the WPP winning photographers of all time:
                        </p>

                            As illustrated above, 
                            in the top 10 countries with the highest 
                            distribution of photographer nationalities, 
                            7 of them are from Europe, 2 of them are form 
                            North America, one, which also features long-term 
                            tradition as a white country, is from Oceania.
                             The highest country outside of the 3 most distributed continents is South Africa, 
                             which also has an all-white distribution of photographers, 
                             followed by Argentina with a white population over 95%. 
                             The highest country with a predominantly non-white populations is Japan, 
                             with an overall 19 awards, far from the top 10 boundaries of 30.
                             <br><br>Given the data we collected, it’s no wonder that the <a1>white supremacy</a1> has long been one of the most crucial
                              controversies around WPP, who had also been accused of <a1>'Structural Racism'</a1>.

                        After facing significant media scrutiny in 2020, WPP has claimed theirselves 
                        to be taking steps to address the situation. An International Advisory 
                        Committee, which will provide guidance on WPP's globalization strategy 
                        going forward, has been established in addition to its Supervisory Board 
                        which is still predominantly composed of white. With the emerging rule only 
                        in effect for two tournaments, its practical effect remains to be seen.</p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 50px;"> 
                            The controversy about the nationality of the photographer 
                            in the previous chapter, in fact, still has more potential 
                            contexts to be explored. It only takes a superficial reflection 
                            to see yet another great controversy: compared to the nationalities 
                            of award-winning photographers with a large deviation distribution, 
                            many countries that have never appeared in the former seem to always 
                            be represented in the winning works, most of which were commonly linked 
                            to the usual topics emerging in award winning stories: <a1>war, poverty, conflict.</a1>
                            <br><br>For further exploration, with the help of AI sequential model, we extracted the exact 
                            location where each photo was taken from its official description, 
                            if possible, and connect them to the photographer’s nationalities.</p>
                        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-globe" data-src="visualisation/13601500" style="margin-top: 50px;">

                            <h6>*We performed the information extraction task using the UIE-Base model
                                 and extracted all the shooting locations with the help of 
                                 Spacy and PyCountry libraries (if possible)</h6>        

                        <p>Nearly 60% of the photos were taken in areas outside of the photographers' 
                            own nationalities, with only 40% being shot in their home countries.<br><br> 
                            Among the photographers who went abroad, we can see that most of them 
                            traveled from the United States to other countries. 
                            Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan are their most common destinations, which makes 
                            it conceivable that war and conflict will be the predominant themes in these 
                            photos they took. <br><br> In contrast, photographers from underdeveloped area rarely go overseas, 
                            such as African country photographers who mostly reside in relatively developed white 
                            communities like South Africa. <a1>In general, the inequality of regional storytelling
                             rights is perfectly manifested.</a1>


                        <p>Regardless of the subjective intentions behind these photographers 
                            leaving their homeland and coming to foreign lands to capture these 
                            stories, there should never been doubt that their photography had
                             played a positive role in exposing local social issues. <br><br>However, one of the simplest 
                             truths remains intact: no matter how hard outsiders try, the ones that can better deliver stories 
                             of own hometowns are always locals. The guarantee of the opportunity to tell the story around 
                             oneself is also due to the most essential journalistic professional requirements, which is the 
                             pursuit of the highest level of truthfulness and reversibility.

                            </p> 
                        <p>It can be seen, again after the concentrated media 
                            blasts in 2020, that WPP has taken some measures 
                            regarding this issue. 
                            In 2021, the institution <a1>announced changes to its organizational structure</a1>
                                 by introducing regions as a primary category, 
                                 stipulated that photographers from different regions should 
                                 compete in separate divisions representing their own regions. 
                                 <br><br><a1>This has been seen as a move to balance regional biases.</a1><br><br>
                                 Two new editions have already been held under renewed regulation in 2022 
                                 and 2023, in which the work of photographers from some of 
                                 the long-neglected regions can finally be appreciated. 
                                 Although accompanied by controversy over the differential treatment, 
                                 these initiatives by WPP have been proved effective in increasing the 
                                 visibility of photographers' work in specific regions.

                            </p>
                        <h4 style="font-family: Arial, serif; font-weight: 900;margin-top: 80px; color: rgb(150, 0, 0)">CONCLUSION</h4>
                        <p style="margin-top: 40px;">Following an explicit logical thread - from the photos themselves, 
                            to the content of the stories they carry, 
                            to the photographers who took them, 
                            and the ways and places they were taken - our process of exploration finally came to some conclusion.
                            </p>
                        <p>For preference, it is evidently shown in WPP's choice of awards, 
                            which can be demonstrated in both terms of forms and stories. 
                            <br><br>Take some examples: a particular preference for black and white or strong color expressions, 
                            and an ongoing focus on stories about specific themes, such as 'protest' and 'war'. 
                            There is no evidence, however, that WPP's preference for these attributes goes 
                            beyond general aesthetic and professional journalistic intuition, 
                            and becomes unfairly biased toward them. Specific choices of topics may 
                            increase exposure, but there is no proof that this will improve the chances of getting a 
                            higher prize. Hence, it is really hard to prove that there are any shortcuts to winning in these dimensions.</p>
                            <p><a1>In other dimensions, however,'shortcuts' are just 
                                too hard to ignore.</a1> As an institution that prides 
                                itself on its global reach and world perspective, its history of strong racial deviance 
                                cries otherwise. The disproportionate number of awards won by white 
                                individuals highlights the ongoing problem of racial inequality in both cultural and 
                                economic spheres worldwide, which is also evident within the field of news photography.
                                 Although WPP has begun to remedy this kind of <a1>"structural racism"</a1>,
                                 its reflection of a clear regional bias in global photojournalism still warrants alarm and urgent correction.</p>
                            <p>As one of the most important news recording vehicles and art forms today, 
                            the connotations and trends faced by photojournalism are 
                            becoming more complex and varied than ever. Although it 
                            is not possible to be truly global and unbiased at this stage, 
                            WPP remains the best player in the role of worldwid leader in photojournalism 
                            development. </p>
