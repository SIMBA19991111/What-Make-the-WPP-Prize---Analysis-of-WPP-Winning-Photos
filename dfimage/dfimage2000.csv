55,Not Specified,2000 Photo Contest,Portraits,"01 January, 1999",F:\Temp\2000\Denis Dailleux,"Every year more than two million people from all over Egypt gather in Cairo for a mawlid for Hussein, the grandson of the prophet Mohammed. For one week many camp out among sacrificial goats and camels. A mawlid is an Islamic religious festival in honor of a saint. Celebrations mingle religious elements with ancient rituals and something of the atmosphere of a country fair. A mawlid is very much a people's festival. Established scholarly religious practice is counterbalanced by popular mysticism, pre-Islamic traditions and trance states. Many of the practices are passed down through generations rather than enshrined in conventional belief.",1st prize,Denis Dailleux,2000
