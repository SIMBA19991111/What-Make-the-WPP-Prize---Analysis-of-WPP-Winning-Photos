4,Not Specified,1963 Photo Contest,General News,"01 January, 1963",F:\Temp\1963\Eddy Veen,"One of the young victims of the drug thalidomide, a sedative prescribed to many women during pregnancy. The side-effects of the drug were inadequately researched; as a consequence, some children were born with severe birth defects such as stunted growth and malformed limbs.
Thalidomide was developed in the 1950s and released into the market in 1957. The drug was primarily prescribed as a sedative or hypnotic. It was also used against nausea and morning sickness in pregnant women. In the late 1950s and early 1960s thousands of children were born with deformities as a consequence of thalidomide use. It is not known exactly how many worldwide victims the drug caused, although estimates ranges from 10,000 to 20,000. The drug was withdrawn from the market in 1961, when the horrible side effects became clear. The thalidomide crisis eventually led to the development of more structured drug regulations.",1st prize,Eddy Veen,1963

Buddhist monk Thich Quang Duc sets himself ablaze to protest the South Vietnamese government’s persecution of Buddhists.

The self-immolation of Thich Quang Duc occurred during the Buddhist crisis in Vietnam, the civilian upheaval against the predominantly Catholic government of President Ngo Dinh Diem, which was supported by the United States. Although the Buddhists constituted a majority of the Vietnamese, Catholics enjoyed special privileges under Diem’s regime. These privileges were resented by the Buddhists, who began establishing religious and secular organizations to create and activate more political and social awareness. The crisis was precipitated by the shootings of nine unarmed civilians on 8 May 1963 in Hue during a demonstration. Following this incident, street demonstrations by Buddhist monks and nuns demanding political reform and religious freedom became frequent and were violently suppressed by the government.",1st prize,Malcolm W.
