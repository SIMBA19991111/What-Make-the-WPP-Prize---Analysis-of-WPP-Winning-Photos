0,Kamloops Residential School,"19 June, 2021","Red dresses hung on crosses along a roadside commemorate children who died at the Kamloops Indian Residential School, an institution created to assimilate Indigenous children, following the detection of as many as 215 unmarked graves, Kamloops, British Columbia.The hanging of red dresses as a visual response to the disproportionate violence faced by women with an Indigenous heritage began in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 2011; orange shirts are also used, specifically to acknowledge suffering caused to children by the residential school system in Canada. Residential schools began operating in the 19th century as part of a policy of assimilating people from various Indigenous communities into Western, and predominantly Christian culture. Students were removed from their homes and parents – frequently by force – and often forbidden to communicate in their own languages. Their hair was cut short, and they had to wear uniforms, rather than traditional clothing, were given Euro-Christian names in place of their own, and were subject to physical and sometimes sexual abuse. Supreme Court Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin claimed Canada used the institutions to commit cultural genocide.","Upwards of 150,000 children passed through the doors of residential schools before the last one closed in 1996. A Truth and Reconciliation Commission, set up in 2009, concluded that at least 4,100 students died while at the schools, as a result of mistreatment, neglect, disease or accident. The Kamloops School, established in 1890, became the largest in the system, attended by hundreds of Secwépemc and other First Nations children. It closed in 1978. In May 2021, a survey using ground-penetrating radar identified as many as 215 potential juvenile burial sites at Kamloops – confirming reports from oral histories.",2022 Photo Contest,North and Central America,Singles,"This winner represents the awakening of a shameful history that is finally being addressed in Canada. It is a perfect image which captures a rare light, and is at once haunting, arresting, and symbolic. The sensory image offers a quiet moment of reckoning with the global legacy of colonization and exploitation, while amplifying the voices of First Nations communities who are demanding justice. The single image requires an active eye, and encourages us to hold governments, social institutions, and ourselves accountable. ",F:\Temp\2022\Amber Bracken,Amber Bracken,2022
1,The People Who Feed the United States,"06 September, 2020","José sits in his room with his sister Sara, in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, USA. José worked in a meatpacking plant until contracting COVID-19 in April 2020. He was in hospital on a ventilator for five months, and still uses an oxygen cylinder. Sara also worked at the factory, but left to become a house cleaner. She took care of her brother during his illness. The stories of migrants working in the US meatpacking industry sheds light on the lives many migrants lead once they reach their destination. The industry, which prepares meat for human consumption, is dominated by large industrial firms, with four companies controlling 70% of nationwide beef production. Immigrant labor makes up a large proportion of workers in an industry known for its long shifts and strenuous working conditions, and where English language skills are not essential. Nationally, immigrants make up 37% of the meat industry labor force, according to the Migrant Policy Institute. In some states, such as Nebraska and South Dakota, that rises to well over half the workforce.","In April 2020, former US president Donald Trump called the meat industry part of the nation’s critical infrastructure, saying plants should remain open despite the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the US Department of Labor, meatpacking workers are exposed to a range of bacteria and viruses, and are at increased risk of illness. COVID-19 spread quickly in an industry where workers operated in close proximity to each other. A study by the US-based Environmental Working Group found that counties with or near meatpacking industries reported twice the national average rate of COVID-19 infection. This was exacerbated by the fact that consolidation in the industry has led to meatpacking plants being located in clusters, and because people in difficult economic circumstances, or who are dependent on overtime pay, may feel a financial pressure to turn up for work, despite the risks.",2022 Photo Contest,North and Central America,Stories,"The jury appreciated these nuanced portraits for their intimate, care, and dignified representations of an often invisible but crucial section in our society – a section that suffered the brunt of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. It approaches the portrayal of migrants in a humane way, unlike so many dehumanizing vantage points permeating the mainstream media and desensitizing us to the hardships of these vulnerable groups. The project allows us to see them as the people they are after they have become ingrained in the fabric of our society, apart from the occupations that they tend to be defined by in the media.",F:\Temp\2022\Ismail Ferdous,Ismail Ferdous,2022
2,Political Year Zero,"18 December, 2019","An aide to Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi adjusts a row of flags in front of a painting of George Washington, at the US Capitol, while preparing for Democratic leaders to speak after the vote to impeach President Donald Trump, on 18 December 2019 – the first of two occasions on which Trump was impeached. The US House of Representatives impeached the president for abusing his power by trying to coerce Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden, then a leading contender for the Democratic nomination to run against him, by allegedly threatening to withhold military aid. A second charge was laid  against the president for obstructing Congress by ordering his administration to not cooperate with the investigation. Trump was later acquitted on both charges by the US Senate.The final year of Donald Trump’s presidency of the US, saw increasing polarization in the country, growing social unrest, and burgeoning disinformation in the media. From early in the run-up to the 2020 US election, President Trump began to make accusations of judicial and electoral subversion. Unrest among his supporters grew into insurrection, culminating in a 6 January 2021 attack on the United States Capitol Building in Washington DC. The photographer has lived in the US capital for more than 15 years documenting social and political issues, and wished to examine and give insight into the background behind the 6 January attack. ","As COVID-19 took hold from early 2020, the president was criticized for his handling of the pandemic, and for undermining scientists and spreading conspiracy theories rather than encouraging mask wearing and social distancing. The murder of George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, who died while being arrested by Minneapolis police on 25 May 2020, led to protests in support of the Black Lives Matter movement by between 15 million and 26 million people nationwide. On 18 September, less than two months before the presidential elections, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, who spent much of her legal career as an advocate for gender equality and women’s rights died.  President Trump and Senate Republicans rushed through the appointment of a new Supreme Court judge, thus preventing Joe Biden from making his own appointment if he won.",2022 Photo Contest,North and Central America,Long-Term Projects,"This project was a very intelligent, insightful and long-term approach to chronicling the course of events leading to the American insurrection of 6 January 2021. The project gives us a fly-on-the-wall, insider account of the myriad of scenes that lead up to the event. The visual rendering is almost theatrical and surreal, just like the event itself, it blurs the lines between the real and the imaginary. The style is akin to that of an unwitting eyewitness, and slows down an otherwise chaotic, spectacle-filled event to give room for contemplation. ",F:\Temp\2022\Louie Palu,Louie Palu,2022
3,The Flower of Time. Guerrero's Red Mountain,"31 December, 2021","A Mixtec elder on the Cerro de la Garza in Guerrero, Mexico. Every year, on 31 December, Mixtecs climb the hill to perform rituals commemorating the end and beginning of a life cycle. They perform processions, dances, and other Indigenous spiritual practices to demonstrate their gratitude to the earth.The project is a series of textured photographs that document the struggle that Indigenous poppy cultivators face in Guerrero, Mexico. The photographer put scratches and pinpricks into prints of the photographs, and then backlit them, to represent trauma as well as the process of scratching of the poppy flower during opium extraction. The color red is used to signify life, blood and violence.","Mexico is the third-largest opium producer in the world after Afghanistan and Myanmar. Over half of Mexico’s opium is grown in its second-poorest state, Guerrero, which is home to several Indigenous ethnic communities. Neoliberal economic policies have been damaging traditional agriculture since the 1990s. This has led to small-scale farmers no longer being able to compete with foreign exporters, forcing them to abandon traditional crops, such as maize and coffee, for more lucrative crops such as opium poppies and marijuana. The drug economy  constitutes a substantial portion of the local economy, and has transformed the social structure of these often Indigenous farming communities.",2022 Photo Contest,North and Central America,Open Format,"This project is a dramatic, people-centric story. It provides a subtle commentary on violence while excluding graphically violent moments, in order to center the community. This is achieved through the effective use of an aesthetic and multilayered technique which gives a mysterious quality. This intentional approach is used to powerfully symbolize the marks of trauma and loss in a community that the photographer himself has experienced personally.",F:\Temp\2022\YaelMartínez,YaelMartínez,2022
4,San Isidro Settlement Eviction,"06 March, 2021","Police agents arrest a man while his wife and family resist, during evictions of people from the San Isidro settlement, in Puerto Caldas, Risaralda, Colombia.","Evictions of residents of the San Isidro settlement began on 3 March 2021 ahead of construction of a railroad planned to connect the capital of the Risaralda district with Buenaventura, Colombia’s main Pacific seaport. The photographer says he would like to give social issues and struggling minorities greater visibility and a better future through his work. Following his photographs and subsequent media coverage, members of the central government intervened and evicted residents from San Isidro were promised rehousing and compensation. They were resettled in temporary shelter, but by early 2022 had still not been relocated to new land.Authorities said the railroad megaproject would bring work and investment to the area, and that the ground did not officially belong to the people being evicted. Economic hardship during the COVID pandemic led to growing numbers of people living in informal settlements around Colombia, with frequent evictions. People in San Isidro, many of whom were of African descent, from Chocó, in the west of the country, or belonged to the Embera Chami community, lived in makeshift shelters, without basic services. Reports in local media stated that local authorities had hurried through the process of claiming land for the railroad project to prevent new settlements in the area.",2022 Photo Contest,South America,Singles,"The jury felt that the image portrays a universally comprehensible expression of intimate belonging in the middle of an urgent moment of resistance. The many layers of action create a commentary on the complex interaction between modern development, the proliferation of industrial mega projects and human rights, asking the question: who are the police really defending? Furthermore, by bearing witness with his camera, the photographer was able to support the peoples' fight for recognition, demonstrating the positive impact that press photojournalism can have in inspiring social change and holding institutions accountable.",F:\Temp\2022\Vladimir Encina,Vladimir Encina,2022
5,Haze,"20 September, 2019","A child in a classroom in Palembang, South Sumatra, Indonesia, covers his face with a mask to avoid the smell of smoke from a forest fire.Indonesia is affected by annual seasonal fires, but has seen some exceptionally large wildfires in recent years. A fire that raged for more than two months in 2015 was one of the worst fires on record this century, destroying some 26,000 km2 of land, an area half the size of Costa Rica. Fire haze, which at times reaches neighboring countries, can affect human health, especially as it carries fine particulate matter, which can penetrate deep into the lungs. A Harvard University study linked the 2015 haze to more than 100,000 premature deaths in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. UNICEF said that wildfires across Kalimantan and Sumatra in 2019 put nearly 10 million children at risk from air pollution.The accelerating wildfire rate is also jeopardizing the country’s progress in reducing deforestation (thus contributing to global heating, as trees absorb CO2). In addition, fires on peat-rich islands such as Borneo and Sumatra have a further impact, as when peat burns it releases massive amounts of CO2 into the environment.Fires usually peak in the July–October dry season. Dry conditions make it easier for fires to be set to clear land for agriculture, but also more likely that they spread out of control. Indonesia is the world’s largest producer of palm oil and industrial-scale land clearance has increased the risk of wildfire immensely. While the Indonesian government has introduced strict laws against burning for land clearance, large companies frequently find loopholes to avoid fines or other sanctions. Indonesia has lost around a quarter of its forest area since the beginning of data collection in 1990, according to the World Bank.","The photographer lives near areas affected by wildfire, and shares his community's anxiety with the approach of every dry season. He wishes to draw attention to the fires, and aims to carry out a campaign to eradicate forest fires in Indonesia.",2022 Photo Contest,Southeast Asia and Oceania,Long-Term Projects,"The jury felt that this project presented an extensive look at one of Southeast Asia's biggest and longest-running environmental problems, which has affected millions across the region. The project effectively uses the long-term format to dive into the toll that this man-made issue has had on both nature and people throughout various seasons.

6,Blood is a Seed,"12 November, 2021","Through personal stories Blood is a Seed (La Sangre Es Una Semilla) questions the disappearance of seeds, forced migration, racism, colonization, and the subsequent loss of ancestral knowledge.During the course of the 20th century, 75% of agricultural plant genetic diversity was lost globally. A main driving force of declining agrobiodiversity is the push for the cultivation of monocultures of modified and often non-native varieties, for higher-yield crops.","The video is narrated by the photographer and their father, and is informed by the father’s memory, as well as their own perceptions of the transformations experienced by small farmers over the last three generations. Romero's father migrated in 1981 in search of better opportunities and to escape the violence that Colombia was experiencing in those years.",2022 Photo Contest,South America,Open Format,"This is a very strong project which approaches an issue of global concern from a personal angle, by reflecting on personal loss. Through investigating her own roots and ancestry, the photographer addresses the violent and strategic erasure of cultural knowledge which continues to have deeply rooted consequences on new generations, broader society and the Earth. The combination of methods and sensory layers – sound, code design and collaborative drawings – build on a clear language that is at once personal and political. The video is well-paced and is a great example of how the Open Format category is a space where photographers can make use of several mediums in a coherent and imaginative way to forward a narrative that is of global relevance.",F:\Temp\2022\Isadora Romero,Isadora Romero,2022
7,Slingshots,"28 March, 2021","Protesters use slingshots and other homemade weapons in a clash with security forces in Yangon, Myanmar.","On 1 February 2021, military leaders staged a coup in Myanmar, hours before a newly elected parliament was to have been sworn in. The military’s proxy party had lost to the civilian National League for Democracy (NLD), headed by Aung San Suu Kyi, putting the NLD in office for the second time since Myanmar’s first nationwide multiparty elections in 2015. Following the coup, the military junta arrested Suu Kyi alongside other lawmakers and activists. Huge protests erupted nationwide, and were met with a harsh military crackdown. International media organizations and a UN official reported that the military were firing live ammunition at civilian protesters and into people’s homes.The photographer remains anonymous for reasons of personal safety. The day before this photograph was taken saw 114 civilians reported killed. The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners reports more than 9,400 people arrested and 1,500 killed by junta forces in the months following the coup. In April, ousted NLD lawmakers and other activists established a parallel government. By the end of the year, the military was still in power, although the parallel opposition government and its armed division prevented the military from consolidating complete control over the country, and resistance continued.Journalists attempting to cover the situation faced intimidation, harassment and violence from military authorities. According to Reporters Without Borders (RSF), 115 journalists were arrested in Myanmar in 2021 while covering protests or after being tracked down by the intelligence services, and three have been killed.",2022 Photo Contest,Southeast Asia and Oceania,Singles,"The image highlights an emerging culture of protest in Southeast Asia, where people have historically faced high consequences for speaking out. The Myanmarese people shooting slingshots against a heavily armed military is highly symbolic and illustrate the determination of the people, who will continue to protect their democracy with whatever means available. By capturing the image from within the group, the image communicates that the photojournalist stands committed to sharing the struggle of these protestors.

8,Saving Forests with Fire,"03 May, 2021","Nawarddeken elder Conrad Maralngurra burns grass to protect the Mamadawerre community from late-season wildfires, in Mamadawerre, Arnhem Land, Australia. The late-evening fire will die out naturally once the temperature drops and moisture levels rise.","Indigenous Australians have strategically burned land to protect their environment for tens of thousands of years. In a practice known as cool burning, fires move slowly, burn only the undergrowth, and remove the build-up of fuel that feeds bigger blazes. As a result, these traditional burns prevent larger, more destructive fires from occurring in the hotter, dryer months of the year. The Nawarddeken people, one of the traditional owners of West Arnhem Land in the north of Australia, see fire as a way to rejuvenate the land, and use it as a tool to manage their 1.39 million hectare homeland. Warddeken rangers use traditional knowledge and combine it with contemporary technologies such as aerial burning and digital mapping to prevent wildfires. In doing so, they have successfully decreased the amount of climate-heating CO2. The emissions saved earn carbon credits, and the proceeds are invested in the community and environmental projects.The photographer is an Australian who once lived in West Arnhem Land and was accepted into a local community. He sees sharing the Warddeken rangers’ solution to wildfires important due to the climate crisis and the intensive bushfires Australia has seen in recent years.",2022 Photo Contest,Southeast Asia and Oceania,Stories,"The story responds to Australia's devastating forest fires and makes us question what the world would look like if we had listened to ancient knowledge. The body of work is a proactive and pragmatic lesson which does not exoticize the Nawarddeken people, a First Nations group, but rather highlights the crucial value of their knowledge in a comprehensive review. While each image is strong on its own, intentional editing, strong pacing, and the sequencing of images illustrates how culture and the environment are inseparable in indigenous cultures. Furthermore, the story provides a refreshing balance of humans and nature in a way which forwards a perspective of interconnectedness and the role of humans as stewards of the land.",F:\Temp\2022\Matthew Abbott,Matthew Abbott,2022

The ‘blur’ portrait raises questions about the role of the king, who avoids smiling to create a calm, respectable self-image akin to the Buddha, in the military coups and state violence that have dominated Thai politics since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932.The project juxtaposes archival images of the 6 October 1976 massacre of students at Bangkok’s Thammasat University with photographs the photographer took during the 2020-2022 Thai pro-democracy protests, in order to understand the root causes of the present-day protests.The 6 October massacre occurred when Thai police and right-wing paramilitaries opened fire on students protesting the return of former military dictator Thanom Kittikachorn to the country. Today’s student protestors are similarly opposed to the current military dictatorship and are also calling for reform of the Thai monarchy.Rachurutchata employs the Japanese method of kintsugi by tearing photographs, then mending them with lacquer and powdered gold.

10,The Promise,"14 August, 2020","Antonella poses for her photograph in the kitchen at home, while in strict lockdown in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on the day she made her promise not to cut her hair till she could resume person-to-person classes.In August 2020, Antonella (12), who lives in Buenos Aires, Argentina, vowed to cut her long hair only when she could resume in-person classes at school, which had been suspended as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Antonella said she was offering up her most precious treasure in exchange for her school life back. Her hair was her identity. She felt she lost her identity without school, and said: “When I finally go back to school they will know I’m a different person, I feel like a different person.” In March 2020, the Argentine government had closed schools across the country in a move to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Around 10.5 million young students experienced disruptions to their education. Antonella’s school did not fully reopen until September 2021. She cut her hair on 25 September 2021, on the weekend before she returned to classes.At least 463 million children worldwide were unable to access remote learning in 2020 when schools across the globe closed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, according to UNICEF. The organization also found that by February 2021 schools in Central and South America and the Caribbean had experienced the world’s longest lockdown. Learning experiences were very much affected by households’ access to technology, internet access, and the availability and ability of parents to provide at-home schooling, with children from low-income households often being impacted the most. A UNICEF poll also indicated that the school closures had an effect on mental health in the region, with students reporting issues with anxiety, depression, and lowered motivation. In Argentina, the lockdowns further disrupted an education system already facing structural issues and issues of economic disparity.The photographer met Antonella in the course of a long-term project researching and photographing women with long hair. As a result of Antonella’s vow, she refocused the project to tell the story of a crisis in education, and of young students’ lives in lockdown.",Keep in touch - Sign up for our newsletter for inspiring examples of the best photojournalism and documentary photography.,2022 Photo Contest,South America,Stories,"The Promise offers an alternative, refreshing perspective of the challenges of the COVID-19 lockdowns in South America.

The statue was destroyed by ultra-nationalists on the night of 8–9 December.In November 2013, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Kyiv in the Ukraine to protest against the decision of pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych to pull out of signing an association agreement with the European Union. Demonstrations, focused on the Maidan (also known in English as Independence Square) in the capital, spread throughout the country, and were violently suppressed. President Yanukovych fled to Russia in February 2014 as a consequence of the demonstrations, and a pro-EU government took power after new elections. ","This exacerbated tensions between the east and west of the country. In March 2014, Kremlin-backed forces occupied the Crimean peninsula. Russian is widely spoken in parts of the east of the country and in the Crimean Peninsula; with roughly 30% of Ukrainians using it as their native language, according to a Ukraine government census. The territory voted to join Russia, in a referendum that Ukraine declared unconstitutional. A month later, separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk seized government buildings and established self-proclaimed people’s republics, a status not recognized by any UN member except for Russia. Clashes between government and separatist forces resulted in heavy casualties on both sides. Russia conducted a number of military exercises near the Ukrainian border, while Ukraine and NATO officials accused Russia of arming the rebels and invading Ukraine territory, a claim Russia denied. Clashes between the Ukrainian army and separatists continued until a tenuous ceasefire in February 2015. ",2022 Photo Contest,Europe,Long-Term Projects,"Amidst a sea of fast paced news events this highly relevant project offers a contemplative look at the largest ongoing conflict in Europe.

12,Amazonian Dystopia,"21 March, 2020","Jasson Oliveira do Nascimento, a resident of the Arapixi Extractive Reserve in the Brazilian Amazon, uses a chainsaw to clear a path for his canoe on his way to collect Brazil nuts. The reserve was established in 2006 as a protected area with sustainable use of natural resources, to safeguard livelihoods and culture of the traditional extractive population. The aim was to protect the area against large-scale soybean farming and cattle ranching, but it is currently being invaded by land-grabbers, who are deforesting the jungle and threatening the way of life of the 300 families who live there.The Amazon rainforest, 60 percent of which lies in Brazil, is under great threat, as deforestation, mining, and exploitation of other resources gains momentum under environmentally regressive policies. Exploitation of the Amazon’s resources – such as minerals and metals including gold, as well as  timber – alongside infrastructural development, such as clearance of land for large-scale farming, hydro-electric schemes and the construction of roads, has led to massive destruction of the natural environment. According to the independent Council for Foreign Relations, Brazil lost around a fifth of its forest cover in the fifty years before 2019. Since 2019, devastation of the Brazilian Amazon has been running at its fastest pace in a decade, according to data from the research institute Imazon.In recent years, fires – often set during land clearance – have led to wildfires, exacerbated by sustained drought conditions brought on by global heating. Conservation regulation and enforcement have been eroded under Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro’s administration. The president encourages farming and mining in protected areas, arguing this will combat poverty. In addition, large infrastructure schemes have been built. Bolsonaro frequently speaks out against environmental protection measures, and makes comments undermining Brazilian courts’ attempts to punish offenders. Environmentalists say that this is encouraging deforestation and creating a climate of impunity.The rainforest serves several key environmental functions both regionally and globally – helping regulate the local weather and global climate. Currently, land conversion and deforestation in the Amazon release up to a billion metric tons of carbon per year, not including emissions from forest fires, according to a study reported in The Guardian. An area of extraordinary biodiversity, with some three million species of plants and animals, including endemic and endangered flora and fauna, the Amazon is also home to more than 350 different Indigenous groups, more than 60 of which still remain largely isolated. In addition to environmental threats, such as soil erosion following deforestation and pollution from gold mining, exploitation of the Amazon has a number of social impacts, particularly on Indigenous communities. The delicate codependence some Indigenous groups have with the forest has been disrupted, and clashes break out as land is forcibly seized. Workers flocking from other parts of Brazil for employment on infrastructure projects have led to an increase in violence in some areas, and a strain on resources in towns.",Keep in touch - Sign up for our newsletter for inspiring examples of the best photojournalism and documentary photography.,2022 Photo Contest,South America,Long-Term Projects,"The project portrays the social, political and environmental realities of Brazil under the presidency of Bolsonaro.

13,Evia Island Wildfire,"08 August, 2021","Panayiota Kritsiopi cries out as a wildfire approaches her house in the village of Gouves, on the island of Evia, Greece.Wildfires broke out on Evia – Greece’s largest island after Crete – in July and August, following the hottest weather Greece had experienced in 30 years. The megafire (so called because of its intensity, size, duration and uncontrolled character) raged through large forests in the north of the island, as well as rural and urban areas, and took almost two weeks to bring under control. Around 1,000 firefighters battled the blaze, with extra equipment flown in from other EU countries, Russia, the UK and the US. Some 2,500 people were evacuated by boat, and, according to the University of Athens, the fire eventually covered an expanse of more than 1,900 square kilometers, more than half the island’s area. Annual fires are a common occurrence in the Mediterranean, but stronger heatwaves led to a longer, more intense annual fire season. Devastating wildfires also took place in Turkey, Italy, Spain in 2021. While global heating is undoubtedly a factor in the fire on Evia, local reports also pointed to other contributing factors, such as rural depopulation (resulting in lack of land management), budget cuts in the fire brigade, and changes in fire management strategies. This photograph became a symbol of the impact of wildfires in Europe. Kritsiopi is quoted as saying: “At that moment I was shouting not only for myself. For the whole village.” In the end, her home remained intact.

14,As Frozen Land Burns,"08 July, 2021","A forest fire burns beside the road between Magaras and Berdigestyakh, in central Sakha, Siberia, Russia.Sakha, also known as Yakutia, which extends over more than three million square kilometers in the far northeast of the Russian Federation, experienced devastating wildfires, severe smoke pollution, and melting of its permafrost in 2021. The region – 40% of which lies within the Arctic Circle – is one of the coldest inhabited places on Earth, with temperatures varying from -60°C in winter to 40°C in summer, according to the Scott Polar Research Institute. The Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme reports that the Arctic is heating three times faster than the global average. In Sakha, even though fires are a natural part of the ecosystem, a mild spring followed by extremely hot and dry weather led to a record-breaking fire season in the region. By mid-August, more than 17.08 million hectares had been ravaged by fire, according to Greenpeace Russia – larger than the areas burned by fires in Greece, Turkey, Italy, the US, and Canada combined. NASA satellite imagery showed smoke from the wildfires to have traveled more than 3,000 km to the North Pole. Firefighters told Agence France-Presse they lacked the personnel and equipment to deal with the wildfires, and critics pointed to a 2015 law that allows authorities to let wildfires burn if the potential damage is considered not worth the costs of containing them. This leads to a slow response time while fires grow ever more out of control.","In addition to the fires, there are indications that higher temperatures are leading to degradation of the permafrost – soil and rocks held together by ice and containing large amounts of organic carbon from frozen plant material. As permafrost melts, this material rots, releasing carbon dioxide and methane, which can be an even more potent greenhouse gas.",2022 Photo Contest,Europe,Stories,"This story of forest fires portrays the issue in a haunting, yet poetic way.

15,Kamloops Residential School,"19 June, 2021","Red dresses hung on crosses along a roadside commemorate children who died at the Kamloops Indian Residential School, an institution created to assimilate Indigenous children, following the detection of as many as 215 unmarked graves, Kamloops, British Columbia.The hanging of red dresses as a visual response to the disproportionate violence faced by women with an Indigenous heritage began in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 2011; orange shirts are also used, specifically to acknowledge suffering caused to children by the residential school system in Canada. Residential schools began operating in the 19th century as part of a policy of assimilating people from various Indigenous communities into Western, and predominantly Christian culture. Students were removed from their homes and parents – frequently by force – and often forbidden to communicate in their own languages. Their hair was cut short, and they had to wear uniforms, rather than traditional clothing, were given Euro-Christian names in place of their own, and were subject to physical and sometimes sexual abuse. Supreme Court Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin claimed Canada used the institutions to commit cultural genocide.","Upwards of 150,000 children passed through the doors of residential schools before the last one closed in 1996. A Truth and Reconciliation Commission, set up in 2009, concluded that at least 4,100 students died while at the schools, as a result of mistreatment, neglect, disease or accident. The Kamloops School, established in 1890, became the largest in the system, attended by hundreds of Secwépemc and other First Nations children. It closed in 1978. In May 2021, a survey using ground-penetrating radar identified as many as 215 potential juvenile burial sites at Kamloops – confirming reports from oral histories.",2022 Photo Contest,World Press Photo of the Year,Kamloops Residential School,"This winner represents the awakening of a shameful history that is finally being addressed in Canada. It is a perfect image which captures a rare light, and is at once haunting, arresting, and symbolic. The sensory image offers a quiet moment of reckoning with the global legacy of colonization and exploitation, while amplifying the voices of First Nations communities who are demanding justice. The single image requires an active eye, and encourages us to hold governments, social institutions, and ourselves accountable. The jury awarded this image the World Press Photo of the Year because it summarizes a global history of colonial oppression that must be addressed in order to tackle the challenges of the future.",F:\Temp\2022\Amber Bracken,Amber Bracken,2022

The body of work is a proactive and pragmatic lesson which does not exoticize the Nawarddeken people, a First Nations group, but rather highlights the crucial value of their knowledge in a comprehensive review. While each image is strong on its own, intentional editing, strong pacing, and the sequencing of images illustrates how culture and the environment are inseparable in indigenous cultures. Furthermore, the story provides a refreshing balance of humans and nature in a way which forwards a perspective of interconnectedness and the role of humans as stewards of the land.This jury awarded this project the World Press Photo Story of the Year because it is solution-oriented and presents knowledge that should be shared around the world in order to tackle the consequences of the global climate crisis.",F:\Temp\2022\Matthew Abbott,Matthew Abbott,2022

The visual language of cause and effect is well balanced. Each image is intentional and impactful, contributing to a collection of testimonies exposing the multilayered effects of the destruction of land, and pillage of natural resources, as experienced by Brazilian communities. Through strong editing and the range of aesthetic elements, the conceptual work looks beneath the surface and explores the psychological change in a people powerfully capturing their experiences of violence and endemic alcoholism.The jury awarded this project the World Press Photo Long-Term Project Award because it powerfully demonstrates the effects of humanities’ abuse of the land and links these realities to a globally comprehensible narrative on the climate crisis.",F:\Temp\2022\Lalo de Almeida,Lalo de Almeida,2022
18,Blood is a Seed,"12 November, 2021","Through personal stories Blood is a Seed (La Sangre Es Una Semilla) questions the disappearance of seeds, forced migration, racism, colonization, and the subsequent loss of ancestral knowledge.During the course of the 20th century, 75% of agricultural plant genetic diversity was lost globally. A main driving force of declining agrobiodiversity is the push for the cultivation of monocultures of modified and often non-native varieties, for higher-yield crops.","The video is narrated by the photographer and their father, and is informed by the father’s memory, as well as their own perceptions of the transformations experienced by small farmers over the last three generations. Romero's father migrated in 1981 in search of better opportunities and to escape the violence that Colombia was experiencing in those years.",2022 Photo Contest,World Press Photo Open Format Award,Blood is a Seed,"This is a very strong project which approaches an issue of global concern from a personal angle, by reflecting on personal loss. Through investigating her own roots and ancestry, the photographer addresses the violent and strategic erasure of cultural knowledge which continues to have deeply rooted consequences on new generations, broader society and the Earth. The combination of methods and sensory layers – sound, code design and collaborative drawings – build on a clear language that is at once personal and political. The video is well-paced and is a great example of how the Open Format category is a space where photographers can make use of several mediums in a coherent and imaginative way to forward a narrative that is of global relevance.The jury awarded this project with the World Press Photo Open Format Award because it connects the personal loss of ancestral knowledge and cultural heritage to the strategic erasure of ancient knowledge and ways of living, in a striking commentary on the consequences of global agrobiodiversity loss.",F:\Temp\2022\Isadora Romero,Isadora Romero,2022
19,Sudan Protests,"30 December, 2021","A protester throws back a tear-gas canister that had been fired by security forces, during a march demanding an end to military rule, in Khartoum, Sudan.","On 30 December, demonstrators marched through the Sudanese capital Khartoum, and in the neighboring cities of Omdurman and Bahri, demanding that the military play no role in a transitional government, and for political power to be transferred to civilian authorities. The protests were brutally suppressed. Reuters reported that five people were killed in the protests.The military had seized control in a coup on 25 October, after long disagreement between civilian members of an earlier transitional government and military members unwilling to share power. The military had dissolved this government, and detained its prime minister, Abdalla Hamdok. Protesters then took to the streets demanding a return to civilian government and the release of Hamdok, but were met with violence. At least seven people were killed and 140 injured in the October protests, according to reports in The New York Times. Unrest continued even after Hamdok’s reinstatement. Internet services were disrupted, and local and international broadcasting networks said that the government barred them from reporting on events. The reinstated prime minister Hamdok resigned early in January 2022 amidst continuing political deadlock.The photographer is Sudanese and lives in Khartoum.

20,The Book of Veles,"The Book of Veles was published in April 2021 as a documentary project on the production of fake news in Veles, a provincial North Macedonian town which placed itself on the world map in 2016 as an epicenter for fake news production. During the 2016 US Presidential election, some residents of Veles created hundreds of clickbait websites posing as American political news portals. As the Veles fake news articles were widely spread via Facebook and Twitter algorithms, many of these 'news hackers' made substantial sums from viewer ad clicks. While it may have been a money-making scheme for certain Veles residents, the presence of these fake websites may have contributed to the visibility of the Trump campaign and therefore inadvertently promoted the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States. The book also weaves in the real story of a forged ‘ancient’ manuscript called The Book of Veles.","Six months after its publication, Bendiksen revealed the project itself was a forgery – all the people portrayed are computer-generated 3D models, and all text was written by an AI. Bendiksen acquired base characters and morphed them to create a range of characters before adding clothing and texture. The backgrounds of the images were made by photographing empty spaces in Veles, which were then converted into 3D spaces. Avatars, the computer-generated 3D models, were placed into the scene, with emotions, poses and lighting that matched the original scene.","The photographs are accompanied by a 5000 word AI-generated essay using GPT-2, a system for creating text that is trained on millions of existing websites. Bendiksen fed this system with articles from English-language media about the fake news industry in Veles as well as real quotes from people who had been involved in fake news production - then selected text from the output.",2022 Photo Contest,Europe,Open Format,"The Book of Veles is a fresh, conceptual project on a highly relevant topic. The photographer consistently maintains a strong narrative throughout the project and intelligently portrays what it means to be living in an age of disinformation. The use of an innovative technique combined with symbolism and irony adds meaning throughout the body of work and makes a bold political commentary. Furthermore, the photographer addresses the moral authority of his own photographic work and presents a form of meta-analysis – using photography as a tool to comment on the state of photography and highlight how vulnerable we are to fake influences in a shifting industry.",F:\Temp\2022\Jonas Bendiksen,Jonas Bendiksen,2022
21,The Zebu War,"20 February, 2013","Two people cross grassland in the Andriry Mountains, an isolated area of Madagascar accessible only on foot and with neither phone network coverage nor electricity.The rural population of southern and western Madagascar face violence and the daily theft of their much-prized humped cattle, zebu, in a complex conflict of different human interests, underscored by environmental and economic issues. Zebu (Bos taurus indicus) were brought to Madagascar from the Indian subcontinent centuries ago. In rural areas, in addition to their role in agriculture and transport, zebu are a symbol of wealth and prestige, and are at the heart of many rituals. In urban areas they are highly valued for their meat, which is served in upscale restaurants.","Groups of men called dahalo (which roughly translates as 'bandits') have stolen zebu for decades, but only a few at a time as dowry gifts for a bride’s family and to prove their virility. Since the 1970s, zebu theft has increased in scale and violence as the focus shifted from ancestral traditions to the monetary value of the cattle. This shift in focus was a result of mounting rural poverty and a food crisis – a situation exacerbated by a 2009 military coup, ongoing drought, and environmental degradation. Organized armed dahalo groups now take hundreds of cattle at a time. Communities report entire villages being burnt down, kidnappings, and murder during cattle raids.",2022 Photo Contest,Africa,Long-Term Projects,"The project highlights the clashes between the armed zebu thieves, the government, and inhabitants of villages on the island of Madagascar. The jury chose this project because the multilayered editing and sequencing of the project highlights the ambiguity of good and bad actors, and underlines how the attempt to create solutions leads to more challenges. The imagery pays homage to a longstanding Malagasi photojournalism tradition, employing an epic visual style to bring dignity to a story. Furthermore, by portraying socio economic divides on the island, the photographer has created a work that is relevant for many contexts on the African continent.",F:\Temp\2022\Rijasolo,Rijasolo,2022
22,The Longing of the Stranger Whose Path Has Been Broken,"01 February, 2021","Yasmine (32) picks wild herbs as she walks through the valley near her home in Sheikh Awad village, South Sinai, Egypt. Yasmine was six months pregnant and walking with the village herd around the mountains of Gharba when the photographer met her almost seven years ago.This collaborative project, made with members of the Jebeliya community, reflects on what it means to be Bedouin in contemporary times. It focuses on the interconnectedness between people and land, which the photographer believes defines the notion of belonging. Bedouins have inhabited the Sinai peninsula for centuries and face stigma and discrimination in Egypt. They face discrimination in Egyptian society to this day due to their perceived role as collaborators during the Israeli occupation of the Sinai from 1967 to 1982, when the Bedouins who resisted the occupation remained on their land to protect it. This discrimination has resulted in Bedouins being barred from joining the army or police force and serving in government, and the profits from the Sinai’s lucrative tourism industry bypassing them.As an Indigenous community, Bedouins have been perceived in the media as isolated from, and a threat to, modern society. Stories of Bedouin women, who were prohibited from being seen by men without consent up until the 1990s, were consistently taken out of context and their images were used without their permission. Challenging this stereotype in the project, portraits of women from the community, printed on fabric, were embroidered by the women themselves, contributing to and taking control of their own representation. While the female participants collaborated through embroidery, the men from the community contributed with handwritten poetry, resulting in a multimedia journey through the identity of the Bedouin community in South Sinai, Egypt.The photographer is a Bedouin rights activist and has been an active member of the community for the past 15 years.",Keep in touch - Sign up for our newsletter for inspiring examples of the best photojournalism and documentary photography.,2022 Photo Contest,Africa,Open Format,"The photographer tells the story of the Bedouin community of South Sinai, Egypt, and portrays cultural practices with subtlety and poetry.

23,Palestinian Children in Gaza,"25 May, 2021","Palestinian children gather with candles in Beit Lahia, Gaza, Palestine, after a protest by children in the neighborhood against attacks on Gaza, during a fragile ceasefire following an 11-day conflict between Hamas and Israel.","The photographer was born and raised in Gaza, and was nine years old when the blockade of Gaza City began in 2006. She decided to tell her story in 2021, through the stories of others, as she finds it difficult to watch childhood events recurring in the present. UNICEF stated that around 500,000 children in Gaza could be in need of psychological support following the 2021 conflict.The 11-day conflict had broken out on 10 May, following rising tensions over threatened evictions in the disputed Sheikh Jarrah district in East Jerusalem, and clashes at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound – one of Islam’s holiest sites – in Jerusalem’s Old City. Hamas, the de facto governing authority in Gaza,  had set Israel an ultimatum, demanding Israel withdraw its security forces from the Al-Aqsa compound, and when the deadline passed, fired rockets on Jerusalem. Israel responded with airstrikes on Gaza. The conflict escalated, spreading to involve other cities in Israel and fire across the borders with Syria and Lebanon, in what became the heaviest outbreak of fighting since the 2014 Gaza War. According to the UN, more than 230 Palestinians were killed, including 106 women and children. The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported 13 casualties in Israel, of which 12 were civilians. A ceasefire was finally agreed on 20 May, coming into effect the following day.",2022 Photo Contest,Asia,Singles,"The photographer portrays the complexities of the ongoing situation in Gaza, particularly in regards to the daily lives of Palestinian children. While, traditionally, photojournalists may view issues from the outside in, the photographer bears witness to the community’s struggle from within. The layering of the image portrays the destruction of the broken landscape in the background while drawing us in, to listen closely to the scene in the foreground. It portrays a quiet intimate moment which forces us to reckon with the reality endured by children in Gaza, but also children’s engagement in the democratic process.",F:\Temp\2022\Fatima Shbair,Fatima Shbair,2022
24,The Cinema of Kabul,"04 November, 2021","Gul Mohammed, who works as an usher in the Ariana Cinema in Kabul, Afghanistan, poses for a photograph nearly three months after the Taliban closed the cinema.","Culture can also be a casualty of war. Following the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021, the Ariana Cinema in Kabul remained closed, its staff in limbo, waiting to hear whether the Islamist fundamentalist Taliban would allow films to be screened. The cinema, which had operated since the 1960s, was one of around half a dozen in the Afghan capital and was restored in 2004, after the previous Taliban government was overthrown. The Ariana is government-owned, and the Taliban allowed male employees to come in for work, but Asita Ferdous – the cinema’s first female director – was not allowed to enter the building. She has since moved to Pakistan, and is seeking asylum elsewhere. In early 2022, the cinema remained closed, and women were no longer allowed to be employed there.The Taliban took control of Afghanistan in mid-August 2021, just weeks after the majority of US and NATO troops had withdrawn from  their bases. During their first period in power, from 1996–2001, the Taliban had imposed a strict interpretation of Islamic law, including compulsory attendance at mosques, a ban on women from working or going to school, and forbidding music and cinema. Immediately after the 2021 takeover, secondary schools for girls were closed, many women were instructed not to return to their jobs, and in some places Taliban fighters stopped live music performances and prohibited people from watching television.The photographer went to  Afghanistan on assignment, and has a personal passion for cinema. He found this situation to be symbolic of the standstill the nation finds itself in since the Taliban occupation.",2022 Photo Contest,Asia,Stories,"The jury felt that this project offers a quiet approach to one of the biggest news events of 2021. The cinematic story is a perspective of the Taliban takeover that we don’t usually see, particularly, it sends a message about how arts, society and culture are all casualties of war, in a way that is universal and can be understood around the world. The project contributes to an ongoing and important conversation about what will happen to Afghan filmmakers and their craft under Taliban control. Juxtaposed against the intensity of war, this muted and suspended story – that is beautiful and well edited – portrays the current limbo of arts and cultural facilitators in a very personal way.",F:\Temp\2022\Bram Janssen,Bram Janssen,2022
25,Boundaries: Human-Tiger Conflict,"15 October, 2015","A night watchman keeps watch from a tower to protect his crops from wild boar and deer, in the village of Ghosri, near the Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve, Chandrapur, Maharashtra, India. Tigers also roam the farmland at times, in search of water, prey, shelter, or marking out new territory. Around 200 tigers live in Chandrapur, of which around 80 share the space outside of the tiger reserve core zone.","In India, Bengal tigers (Panthera tigris tigris) and residents of villages in and around animal sanctuaries come into conflict. Bengal tigers are considered endangered, with up to 3,000 surviving in the wild. Human settlement, cultivation, and urban development are encroaching on tigers’ natural habitat and reducing their prey-base.India has some 500 wildlife sanctuaries, including 50 tiger reserves, with thousands of villages situated inside or around the perimeters. Villagers are often from Indigenous communities, and are dependent on their livestock, farming, or the forest for their livelihoods. Conflict arises when tigers kill livestock, either within the reserves, in pastures around the perimeters, or in important migration corridors between the reserves. A simultaneous decrease in forest cover and expansion of a tiger population may cause tigers to seek new territory. Also, old or injured tigers that are weak and unable to hunt may leave their territories, and, with no other option, frequent populated areas and prey on livestock or humans. Purposeful attacks on humans are rare, and usually occur when angry groups surround tigers who have entered settlements. When villagers continually lose their livestock, they may poison tigers – a measure illegal under Indian conservation laws. Forest officials occasionally shoot tigers when they see that as the only practical solution in situations threatening human life.The Indian government is attempting to mitigate human-tiger conflict in a number of ways, including capture and relocation of problem tigers (which is often difficult to do, and can simply transfer the conflict to a new situation); employing human herders to guard livestock, payment of compensation to victims, and the relocation of human settlements. Although consolidating tiger habitats by moving humans has helped wild tiger populations recover, it can lead to human hardship and resentment if not carried out in a way that is transparent, incentive-driven and fair. Some people see relocation as eviction from their place of origin, and have protested at what they consider a violation of their community rights.The photographer was born and raised in southern India, and has been working with conservationists, forest officials, and local villagers for the past ten years, to understand and document the various dimensions of human-tiger conflict.",2022 Photo Contest,Asia,Long-Term Projects,"This project is highly relevant for a region where so many people are living in rural villages, and skillfully portrays both human and tiger worlds. The photographer poses the challenge of tigers affecting human communities, as a symptom to a larger issue of global environmental change. While we can accept that the problem is essentially created by humans, the project shows great empathy for both sides of the struggle. Even more, there is an equally important third perspective of conservationists and forest guards who inhabit a role of trying to balance both human and nonhuman interests. The visual language of loose, blurry frames conveys movement and the urgency of survival for both humans and tigers in the wake of regional environmental change. The consistently well edited and sequenced work effectively communicates this complex challenge.",F:\Temp\2022\Senthil Kumaran,Senthil Kumaran,2022

Gunmen, apparently from a bandit group, snatched 279 girls from dormitories in the middle of the night, at the Government Girls Secondary School in the village.","Nigeria is facing severe education challenges, as kidnappings of students for ransom by Islamist groups and armed gangs continue to impact schools in the north of the country. President Muhammadu Buhari has stated that more than 12 million children, girls in particular, are currently traumatized and fear going to school. This can contribute to many girls being taken out of school to work, or forced into marriage, according to Human Rights Watch. UNICEF reports that Nigeria has the highest rate of child marriage in West Africa, with 22 million women and girls married before the age of 18.The first mass school abduction in Nigeria took place in April 2014, when members of the Islamic extremist group Boko Haram kidnapped more than 200 girls from a government boarding school in Chibok, Borno State, in the northeast of the country. A Bring Back Our Girls global campaign led to international protests and contributed to wider discussions about girls’ and women’s access to education. Kidnappings have continued and now extend to boys, too, yet have largely fallen from international media attention. Boko Haram as well as other jihadist groups kidnap students to oppose Western secularism; other gangs do so in the hope of gaining quick cash through ransoms. Hostages have also been used to bargain for the release of imprisoned Boko Haram members.The photographer has witnessed a relative navigate the trauma of kidnapping in Nigeria.
