0,The Dying River,"11 March, 2022","Alfredo, Ubaldo, and José tend beehives near Wenden in the Arizona desert, United States. A substantial decrease in rainfall in the area means that the men must now provide water for the bees in troughs.","Heat and drought weakens bees, making them more susceptible to pathogens and parasites, and impacts the plants from which they feed. Between 2019 and 2020, colonies of managed honey-bees declined by 43.7% across the US. Bees are vital for pollinating many crops, and so play an important role in food security for humans.",2023 Photo Contest,North and Central America,Singles,"This portrait of beekeepers is visually clean and sparks interest and curiosity to understand the issue at hand. The image is subtle and understated, and the jury was impressed by the composition of bees across all thirds. While the topic resonates at a global level, the image itself encourages us to sit with these particular people and consider how they might be impacted by the ongoing environmental crisis.",F:\Temp\2023\Jonas Kakó,Jonas Kakó,2023
1,Maria's Journey,"23 June, 2021","Maria Hernandez walks home from shopping in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, while awaiting a decision on her immigration case, in order to travel to the United States to reunite with her daughters.","When Maria Hernandez and her two daughters, aged eight and three, arrived in the United States from Honduras in search of asylum in July 2017, border authorities apprehended them. The authorities deported Maria, but her children remained behind. US officials at first arranged for the girls to stay in a children’s shelter; later, they went to live with Maria’s adult son, who was already in the country. ",2023 Photo Contest,North and Central America,Stories,"This project answers many questions about the outcome of one's journey of displacement. It offers a clear and complete narrative on the chronology of Maria’s story, portraying how migration is not a solution, but rather a trigger to a whole new set of challenges. The story offers a unique, emotional perspective on migration that is different from mainstreamed stories. The jury was impressed by the photographer's selection of images which demonstrated their commitment to accurately narrating Maria's story over time, across countries. The story stood out as a subversion of the typical displacement story coming from Central America.",F:\Temp\2023\Carlos Barria,Carlos Barria,2023

The jury was impressed by the work’s compelling storytelling which brings a shocking, and intimate experience to the world and portrays the ripple effects of global supply and demand. The images are subtle, nuanced and edited beautifully in a way which maintains the dignity of the community photographed and creates an emotional reading of their story. This is an underreported story that the jury hopes it will make an impact in exposing the corrupt government structures that promote such harmful agrochemicals use.",F:\Temp\2023\Cristopher Rogel Blanquet,Cristopher Rogel Blanquet,2023
3,The Voice of New York Is Drill,"04 August, 2022","Kenzo B (18) is one of the few young up-and-coming women artists in the Brooklyn drill scene. Although there have been a number of women artists, drill artists have been predominantly men. The Bronx, New York, United States.","Originally from the streets of Chicago, United States, drill is the newest subgenre of hip-hop to blow up globally, influencing artists from the United Kingdom to Brazil to Korea. While its sound – fusing aggressive, raw lyrics with pounding, rapidly syncopated drums – may be a new phenomenon, the story of its rise is a familiar one in the history of rap music. Like generations of musicians before them, drill artists transform the pain and desperation of their experiences coming of age in some of the most impoverished neighborhoods in the United States into a distinct form of musical expression. ",2023 Photo Contest,North and Central America,Open Format,"The collection of beautifully framed images pays homage to the history of hip hop while also situating us in the current reality of Drill artists in New York. The photographer presented an intersectional story that highlights how art imitates the lives of the drill artists, and elucidates how their music is used against them to criminalize and incarcerate their community. The diversity of images play off of music and sound and the atmospheric portraits enable one to see and hear how these people live and see the world. It is an extraordinary example of portraiture work.",F:\Temp\2023\Ashley Peña,Ashley Peña,2023

UNHCR reported that Colombia hosted some 1.8 million Venezuelan refugees and migrants by May 2022, the largest portion of the diaspora. ","Millions of Venezuelans have left their country to live abroad, driven by economic collapse, political unrest, high unemployment, and extreme social inequality. ",2023 Photo Contest,South America,Long-Term Projects,"This conceptual project engages the viewer in a story about the evolution of the economic and political crisis of Venezuela. It presents a multilayered issue of regional relevance with subtlety, sparking curiosity and evoking a comparison between the photographer’s memory and the broader reality. Each image is intentional and touches on different longlasting issues faced by Venezuelans. The images are beautifully framed and while some are quick and easy to read others build a stronger understanding of the topic in indirect ways.",F:\Temp\2023\FabiolaFerrero,FabiolaFerrero,2023

The photographer captures a multilayered story and balances narratives about loss and preservation. The jury was impressed by how the story narrates the relationship between people, culture and identity and demonstrates how they are deeply tied to all aspects of the changing environment and the animals living in it. The project is beautifully photographed, full of humor, and provides the perfect amount of information. Moreover, it is a perfect edit from start to finish as each frame is relevant and meaningful to the story, allowing the viewer to become invested. ",F:\Temp\2023\Alessandro Cinque,Alessandro Cinque,2023
6,Passengers,,"On 1 August 2016, a boat bound for Italy carrying 118 people was found drifting off the coast of Libya. It was one of many boats that attempted the crossing that year, one small part of a larger wave of migration from Africa to Europe that is usually reported in European news media as a humanitarian crisis represented in abstract figures. And while the numbers are staggering -- according to the United Nations Refugee Agency in 2016 over 300,000 refugees and migrants arrived in Europe and 3,211 were reported dead or missing attempting to reach Europe -- the story is incomplete. Who are the individuals behind those numbers and what happens to them after their arrival in Europe? ","The Passengers project, presented as a multimedia website for De Volkskrant, highlights several personal stories from the people who were on that boat in 2016 as they seek to establish new lives across the continent. Their experiences vary greatly: some find a sense of place, some a provisional home, and others are still adrift, questioning their decision to leave. Common to each story is the way they go beyond the numbers, depicting deeply individual trajectories and diverse personal struggles. ",2023 Photo Contest,Europe,Open Format,"This project could have stopped at its strong portraits, but instead the photographer followed the participants across borders to tell a thorough and dignified story about their migration journey. The project was focused and made excellent choices about what parts of the story to follow in order to bring humanity to a group of people who are often othered across Europe and in mainstream media. The jury was impressed by the phenomenal web presentation and strong photography that spans from the men's arrival in Italy to their settlement in different countries.",F:\Temp\2023\Cesar Dezfuli,Cesar Dezfuli,2023
7,Shifting,Valentina is a 13-year-old who aspires to become a photographer and whose mother is in prison for marijuana possession.,"In Latin America, the incarceration of women has increased dramatically over the last two decades. More than half of the women imprisoned in Ecuador have been charged with drug related crimes and the vast majority of these are for micro-trafficking, the sale of minimal amounts of drugs. The adoption of increasingly punitive laws as a part of the war on drugs and the ongoing prison crisis in the country means that women prisoners are disproportionately impacted and especially vulnerable to prison violence, abuse, and neglect. ","Valentina is a 13-year-old who aspires to become a photographer and whose mother is in prison for marijuana possession. Ecuador’s pre-trial detention policy and punitive sentencing policy means that the separation between mothers and their children has been especially harrowing and increasingly common. Despite the break in their familial bond, the video and imagery in this multimedia project center around the imagination and experiences of Valentina as a young artist, whose rich inner world is not entirely defined by her mother’s incarceration, even as she awaits their reunion. ",2023 Photo Contest,South America,Open Format,"A beautifully executed project that approaches the impacts of incarceration on women and their children in Ecuador from a rarely seen, dignified angle. The jury was impressed by the photographer’s respectful collaboration with 11-year-old Valentina to narrate an intersectional issue from her perspective while centering her past experiences and aspirations for the future. The project takes full advantage of available multimedia tools to portray Valentina's inner world– elements of the story that couldn’t otherwise be captured through photography.",F:\Temp\2023\Johanna Alarcón,Johanna Alarcón,2023
8,Retrieving the Dead,"21 February, 2022","Resistance fighters from the People's Defense Forces (PDF) retreat with the body of a comrade, following a clash with the Myanmar military, in Moe Bye, Kayah (Karenni) State, Myanmar.","Myanmar authorities had sent reinforcements to the region as fighting with local opposition groups intensified. Moe Bye was strategically important as it gave the military access to roads leading to areas where armed resistance was especially strong. By 16 February, almost all of the town's civilian residents had fled.",2023 Photo Contest,Southeast Asia and Oceania,Singles,"This image captures the solemnity of defeat. One can hear the quiet of the men and their boots crunching in the grass as they carry a fallen soldier home. The jury was impressed by the insider lens documented by the local photographer, how they show care, deference, and respect towards the dead despite the brutal view of the mutilated soldier. All of the colors play off of each other in a way that brings greater attention to the silhouette at the center of the frame. The image is a universal reminder of the state of the world wherein people are forced to put their lives on the line to fight for something they believe in.",F:\Temp\2023\Mauk Kham Wah,Mauk Kham Wah,2023
9,Home for the Golden Gays,"18 July, 2022","Al Enriquez (86) looks through a curtain in the the Golden Gays’ home in Manila, the Philippines. ","The Golden Gays are a community of older LGBTQI+ people from the Philippines who have lived together for decades, sharing a home, caring for each other as they age, and staging shows and pageants to make ends meet.",2023 Photo Contest,Southeast Asia and Oceania,Stories,"This project enlists an intersectional approach to portray the multilayered experiences of LGBTQI+ identifying people in the Philippines. The photographer holds the people in such high regard and has them shining at the highest capacity. The images are stunning frames of love, joy, and celebration and the community the people surround themselves with. The project is well executed, beautifully photographed, and successfully centers the community's demonstrations of trust and resilience, instead of indulging in despair. ",F:\Temp\2023\HannahReyes Morales,HannahReyes Morales,2023

Five masked men barged into Jomar Libo-on’s home as he was watching TV, and shot him in front of his wife, son and daughters.This project documents the Philippines‘ drugs offensive from its outset, capturing its broadening focus and the continued impact on families involved.","Soon after taking office in June 2016, Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte began a concerted ‘war on drugs’, repeatedly ordering attacks against suspects. A surge of extrajudicial killings followed, perpetrated not only by police but also by masked vigilantes and other civilians. The Philippine National Police admits to more than 6,000 such deaths to date; local human rights organizations put the figure at 30,000. The police appear to act with impunity, with only a handful of these killings being seriously investigated and almost no prosecutions.",2023 Photo Contest,Southeast Asia and Oceania,Long-Term Projects,"The drug war in the Philippines is a topic that the jury has seen tackled numerous times, however this project resonated as a slow, subtle, underreported perspective. The images show survivors of the detritus as well as their profound grief– apparent on the many faces of the people pictured. The photographer made intentional intimate choices and centered the experiences of families. She successfully highlights the consequences of the country's last regime, and demonstrates how the social fabric of the Philippines is forever altered.",F:\Temp\2023\Kimberly dela Cruz,Kimberly dela Cruz,2023

Repsol, the Peruvian government, and the Italian tanker company each disputed the cause of the spillage, trading accusations of negligence, inadequacy of equipment, and mismanagement.",2023 Photo Contest,South America,Singles,"This image resonates globally and is a synecdoche of corporate malfeasance, government neglect, and the environmental disaster which ensues. The jury felt that it was a powerful, beautifully captured visual from one of this year’s breaking news stories. It communicates the devastating ecological impacts of oil extraction in this area with both subtlety and clarity.",F:\Temp\2023\Musuk Nolte,Musuk Nolte,2023
12,Net-Zero Transition,"19 July, 2020","A geodesic dome covers the injection well of a geothermal power plant, in Hellisheiði, Iceland. ","The plant captures geothermal energy from the volcanic Hengill mountain. Geothermal power plants draw fluids from underground reservoirs to the surface to produce steam, which then drives turbines to generate electricity. The process is not emissions-free, as the remaining fluids contain harmful condensates, but the plant injects these back into deep bedrock, where the CO2 can turn rapidly into minerals. The dome covers the borehole and equipment, reducing the visual impact on the environment. By January 2022, this plant had fixed over 100,000 tonnes of CO2 in this way. In cases where carbon emissions cannot be avoided, such carbon fixing can be a valid alternative, although critics say that carbon-capturing technologies detract from the more  pressing need to reduce carbon emissions in the first place. This project documents different technologies that offer possible routes of transition to a net-zero economy. The photographer visited innovative facilities across Europe, from Iceland to Italy, from 2020 to 2022.",2023 Photo Contest,Europe,Long-Term Projects,This project is an impressive example of solutions based journalism wherein the photographer's commitment to gaining access and incredible research offers a unique perspective into European efforts to secure a sustainable future. The project boasted beautiful aesthetics and its clinical scientific approach gives the audience space to visualize and conceptualize each solution without leading with emotion. The project is thought provoking and demonstrates the relationship between the scale of the crisis and the scale of solutions.,F:\Temp\2023\Simone Tramonte,Simone Tramonte,2023
13,"Woman, Life, Freedom",This photo-based video offers a rare and personal glimpse into the dangers faced by protestors on the streets of Iran today.,"On 16 September 2022, Mahsa “Jina” Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman, died after she was arrested by the Islamic Republic’s morality police for allegedly violating the country’s strict rules restricting the dress and conduct of women. The protests, which began in Amini’s hometown of Saqez, quickly intensified, spreading across the country with support from Iranians of all ages, genders, and ethnicities. The Islamic Republic responded by disrupting internet access, intimidating journalists, and violently repressing uprisings with state security forces. Because hospitals are controlled by the regime, anyone injured in the protest risks arrest and further abuse upon seeking medical attention. ","This photo-based video project narrates one chaotic night in the life of an Iranian nurse as she fights to save the life of a young man named Reza, who is badly wounded by crossfire at a protest. Reza is dying and needs immediate medical attention, but the nurse fears that if he is taken to a hospital he will be arrested rather than given medical care. Instead, at great risk to herself, she takes him home and gives him a blood transfusion from her own body, saving his life. ",2023 Photo Contest,Asia,Open Format,"The jury was interested in this unique angle of widespread protests in Iran. The successful combination of photography, narrative audio, and video provides thorough information from the perspective of a nurse. The photographer successfully collected the visuals in a highly authoritarian context where gaining access to these stories is increasingly difficult. The project managed to connect with the jury on both a micro and macro level by recording the personal thoughts and emotions of the nurse while also communicating the bigger picture of the fight for women's freedoms in Iran. ",F:\Temp\2023\Anonymous,Anonymous,2023

Ukrainian authorities reported five people killed and a further 15 wounded in the city that day.","Russian forces began advancing towards Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, as soon as their full-scale invasion began on 24 February. Russia may have regarded Kharkiv, some 35 kilometers from the border, as an easy target due to its large number of Russian-speaking inhabitants; instead Russian forces were met with fierce resistance. Throughout March and April, the city was partially encircled and remained under heavy shelling. In May, Ukraine forced a Russian withdrawal from the immediate surroundings of Kharkiv, although much of provincial Kharkiv remained under Russian control throughout the summer, and shelling frequently reached the city. By 14 September, Ukrainian forces had regained control of the province. ",2023 Photo Contest,Europe,Singles,"This is a visually simple photo that highlights the reality of daily life in Ukraine and the thin line between life and death that civilians walk everyday. Taken in a sensitive moment, the image is loaded with grief and heartbreak, and boldly accomplishes the directness that the jury was looking for in a single image. The soft quality of colors creates a sense of quiet amidst the very loud pain. It is an image that forces the viewer to reckon with the spontaneity of violent Russian attacks and the psychological impacts and terror they cause on those who survive. ",F:\Temp\2023\Alkis Konstantinidis,Alkis Konstantinidis,2023

The Syr Darya skirts Uzbekistan and flows through Kazakhstan into what remains of the Aral Sea.Access to water is one of the most contentious local issues in Central Asia today. Four landlocked countries compete over the water supplies they share – a situation intensified by the climate crisis. ","For decades, interdependence between Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, upstream on the Syr Darya and Amu Darya rivers, and Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan downstream, encouraged peaceful interaction over use of this resource  – but drought, conflicting needs, and water mismanagement are disrupting this long-standing cooperation. Post-Soviet independence of the four countries, the subsequent growth of national identities, and the rise of privatized industries all contribute further to this imbalance.",2023 Photo Contest,Asia,Long-Term Projects,"This was a strong visual project that delved into a complex, multilayered story about the varied impacts of climate change in Central Asia. The photographer stayed clear of regional clichés and instead, thoughtfully represents water struggles/scarcity by depicting people’s diverse relationships to and uses of water in its various forms. There is a smooth connection of images across countries that are all united by the same struggles.

Police prohibited people from carrying the coffin on foot through the city, which is customary for notable deaths, as mourners chanted “We sacrifice our soul and blood for you, Shireen”.Shireen Abu Akleh, a veteran reporter of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, was shot two days earlier while covering an Israeli military raid in Jenin, West Bank. She was wearing a helmet and a blue vest labeled “PRESS” at the time. Another journalist at the scene, Al Jazeera producer Ali al-Samoudi, was wounded by a bullet in the back. He said that no Palestinian fighters were present when they were shot, and that journalists were not warned or asked to leave. International media and organizations such as Bellingcat, Forensic Architecture, and The Washington Post investigated and corroborated the claims. ","A Palestinian investigation concluded Abu Akleh had been intentionally targeted. After initially rejecting these allegations, the Israeli military has since admitted there was a “high possibility” Abu Akleh was shot by an Israeli soldier, but denies deliberate targeting. Both the US Department of Justice and the International Criminal Court have launched investigations into the shooting.Reporters Sans Frontières says that 55 journalists and four media workers were killed worldwide in 2022 for reasons linked to their activities. ",2023 Photo Contest,Asia,Singles,"This image represents multiple aspects of the ongoing occupation of Palestine– the lack of press freedom and the inability for Palestinians to lay their dead to rest and mourn. In this image, one can hear and feel a chaos frozen in time, while the composition helps to convey the brutal hardline of security forces disrupting Abu Akleh's funeral procession. For the jury, the image serves as an emotional reminder of the continued fight for press freedom and a world where journalists are noncombatants who should be able to depict truth.",F:\Temp\2023\Maya Levin,Maya Levin,2023

Steadily rising temperatures have led to damaging fires and water scarcity, upsetting this balance and putting the oases’ existence in jeopardy. Overgrazing exacerbates the problem. In the past, oasis water in Morocco was supplied by underground tunnels known as khattara, which tapped groundwater and brought it to the surface for irrigation. An increasing demand for water, coupled with a dwindling natural supply, means that this sustainable source is insufficient, so people have begun to sink wells (sometimes illegally). Water extracted from lower levels in the water table has a higher salt content, contaminating the soil and affecting its fertility. ",2023 Photo Contest,Africa,Long-Term Projects,"This is a slow burning climate story that portrays the varied impacts of the climate crisis on oasis communities in Morocco. The edit of subtle imagery is executed beautifully and captures the encroachment of the desert on dwellings.

The story addresses the many layers of cross-cutting issues relating to labor, migration, development, and inequality that resonate across the continent. The jury felt that the style of clean, straight lines is aesthetically beautiful and contrasts with typical depictions of the region. Ironically, the images are too clean in a way which alerts the viewer to the range of issues emerging from a changing landscape and subsequently changing identities.

Zenabu shows some signs of confusion and memory loss associated with dementia.This photograph is part of a personal project aimed at drawing attention to often overlooked stories about dementia from the African continent. As life expectancy rises, dementia is increasingly becoming a public health and socio-cultural issue in Africa. Numbers of people living with dementia in sub-Saharan Africa are projected to double every 20 years. While key policy makers highlight trends in dementia care, treatment, and prevention, less attention is given to cultural perceptions of the condition.","People who hold traditional beliefs in Ghana and across sub-Saharan Africa sometimes see dementia symptoms such as confused speech, uncontrolled swearing, and disoriented wandering as signs of sorcery. Women are accused of being witches more frequently than men. In Ghana, they may flee or be sent away to live in so-called “witch camps”. The camps are controversial. On the one hand, they offer refuge and protection from violence; on the other, residents are stigmatized, and open to exploitation by local chiefs, who earn money from trials and rituals associated with witchcraft. Nurses from local communities who are sensitive to traditional beliefs, can play a bridging role in education about dementia, and so in reducing discrimination and stigmatization. ",2023 Photo Contest,Africa,Singles,"The photographer tackles a global public health issue that is usually hidden across Africa. The jury identified the photo’s high visual quality and use of symbols to reflect on people’s experiences of dementia and other age-related illnesses.

They built their homes right along the Mahmoudiyah canal, which connected their fishing boats to the Mediterranean. Life on the waters of the canal may have appeared idyllic, especially to photographers like Mohamed Mahdy, who was initially drawn to the site for its atmosphere, but making a living fishing at Al Max has always been difficult. International environmental agreements restrict the number of days residents can fish. Pollution from surrounding factories force fishermen to sail farther out to sea on small wooden boats, which endangers their boats and their lives. Despite the challenges, the people here have formed a strong and unique community and culture.","In 2020, the Egyptian government began evicting parts of Al Max and relocating people to housing several kilometers away from the canals. So far, about a third of the neighborhood of Al Max has been relocated. The government cites rising sea levels due to global climate change and a need for urban renewal and development as reasons for relocation, but many residents remain skeptical of its necessity. What is certain is that relocation means not only demolishing homes, but endangering the collective memories and local culture embedded in the neighborhood of Al Max. The stories captured by this project speak to the precarity of people everywhere striving for recognition amid global economic and environmental upheaval. ","People of the Al Max community speak of love letters or last words found in bottles that would wash on to their shores. For this project, Mohamed Mahdy encouraged residents to write their own letters, building an archive of private memories for future generations.

Consequently, all international aid, which in 2019 accounted for an estimated 80 percent of the country’s expenditures, was halted, and 7 to 9 billion dollars of assets belonging to the Afghan state were frozen. Without these two sources of government income, the already fragile Afghan economy effectively collapsed. ",2023 Photo Contest,World Press Photo Story of the Year,The Price of Peace in Afghanistan,"A concise edit reflecting on the aftermath of the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan. Each photo provides new information, culminating in a comprehensive selection of nine powerful images. The project demonstrates an airtight, traditional approach that elucidates the failures of the American adventure in Afghanistan to give us a well rounded look at how these failures have impacted the people. The jury remarked that this is truly extraordinary work especially as it covers so many different layers of life under Taliban rule.",F:\Temp\2023\Mads Nissen,Mads Nissen,2023
24,Mariupol Maternity Hospital Airstrike,"09 March, 2022","Iryna Kalinina (32), an injured pregnant woman, is carried from a maternity hospital that was damaged during a Russian airstrike in Mariupol, Ukraine. Her baby, named Miron (after the word for ‘peace’) was stillborn, and half an hour later Iryna died as well.Russia’s attacks on Ukrainian cities have resulted in widespread suffering and death of at least 21,000 civilians, according to the UN Human Rights Office. When Russian forces invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022, they immediately targeted the strategically important port of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov. Russian shelling devastated the city, including numerous civilian targets, such as the maternity hospital photographed here. ","At first, Russia labeled reports of the attack on the hospital, which resulted in three deaths and some 17 injuries, as fake news. Later, the Russian foreign affairs minister Sergey Lavrov said it had been deliberate, claiming the hospital had been taken over by paramilitaries, and that patients and staff had been evacuated. An investigation by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) concluded the hospital was deliberately targeted by Russia, in violation of international humanitarian law, and that those responsible had committed a war crime.",2023 Photo Contest,World Press Photo of the Year,Mariupol Maternity Hospital Airstrike,"The first image from Europe's winning story was awarded the World Press Photo of the Year. The jury felt that this image captures the absurdity and horror of war. It is an accurate representation of the year's events and evidence of the war crimes being committed against Ukrainian civilians by Russian forces. The image rises as a deeply painful historical fact and highlights the murder of future generations of Ukrainians. By giving the image a platform, the jury hopes that the world will stop and acknowledge the intolerable realities of this war and consider the future of Ukraine.",F:\Temp\2023\Evgeniy Maloletka,Evgeniy Maloletka,2023
25,Australian Floods in Infrared,"31 March, 2021","Flooding of the Hawkesbury River, a major waterway that encircles the Sydney metropolitan region in Australia. While impacts to major urban areas were generally flash flooding rather than widespread flooding, key roads and bridges across the Hawkesbury were flooded for over 6 days and vehicular ferries were out of service for over 9 days. Overall, the March 2021 flood was the largest in the region in 30 years. Global climate change means not only a rise in average temperature, but also an increase in the rate of extreme weather events. In the Hawkesbury-Nepean Valley and other regions of New South Wales, Australia, this has likely exacerbated extreme flooding. In March 2021, flooding in the area led to the evacuation of 18,000 people and necessitated over 1,000 flood rescues by emergency services. These extreme weather events are only increasing in frequency and intensity, damaging property and disrupting infrastructure and supply lines for food and medicine in one of the most populous regions of Australia. ","This series offers a unique perspective on the recent floods that have devastated New South Wales. Aerial infrared imaging renders vegetation in pinks and reds, contrasting sharply against blues and cyans, which represent water. These images make newly flooded areas easily discernible to post-disaster emergency responders, assisting with response and recovery. Beyond their utility to scientists, hydrologists and emergency responders, these images offer a visually striking perspective on the real time environmental and social impacts of the global climate crisis.",2023 Photo Contest,Southeast Asia and Oceania,Open Format,"This project appropriates infrared imaging, a technology popularized for its military uses, and uses it to tackle a very different, very important event relating to the climate crisis. The work is visually interesting and ripe with beautiful colors that kept the jury's attention. Each frame enticed them to seek more information. The work presented important insights in a clever way and gave space for one to consider the global intensification of flooding and its complex impacts.",F:\Temp\2023\Chad Ajamian,Chad Ajamian,2023

Her baby, named Miron (after the word for ‘peace’) was stillborn, and half an hour later Iryna died as well.","The port of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov was the first city struck when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, on 24 February 2022. Civilians were hit hard. ",2023 Photo Contest,Europe,Stories,"This story depicts the reality of Russian attacks on Mariupol in a direct way, without indulging in tragedy and other visual possibilities. The story is full of rare and historic images from different angles at a ground level, packaged and edited flawlessly to communicate the civilian toll of war. Each image left a mark on the jury. They were struck by how the Ukrainian photographer risked his life to access visuals of Russian combatants and make these images available to the world. This story will rise as a collection of haunting iconic images of the ongoing war.",F:\Temp\2023\Evgeniy Maloletka,Evgeniy Maloletka,2023
27,"Here, The Doors Don't Know Me","Using found imagery and the artist’s own photography, Mohamed Mahdy’s project presents an elegy to a communal way of life on the cusp of disappearing. For generations, the residents of Al Max, a fishing community in Alexandria, Egypt, have lived close to the water. They built their homes right along the Mahmoudiyah canal, which connected their fishing boats to the Mediterranean. Life on the waters of the canal may have appeared idyllic, especially to photographers like Mohamed Mahdy, who was initially drawn to the site for its atmosphere, but making a living fishing at Al Max has always been difficult. International environmental agreements restrict the number of days residents can fish. Pollution from surrounding factories force fishermen to sail farther out to sea on small wooden boats, which endangers their boats and their lives. Despite the challenges, the people here have formed a strong and unique community and culture.","In 2020, the Egyptian government began evicting parts of Al Max and relocating people to housing several kilometers away from the canals. So far, about a third of the neighborhood of Al Max has been relocated. The government cites rising sea levels due to global climate change and a need for urban renewal and development as reasons for relocation, but many residents remain skeptical of its necessity. What is certain is that relocation means not only demolishing homes, but endangering the collective memories and local culture embedded in the neighborhood of Al Max. The stories captured by this project speak to the precarity of people everywhere striving for recognition amid global economic and environmental upheaval. ","People of the Al Max community speak of love letters or last words found in bottles that would wash on to their shores. For this project, Mohamed Mahdy encouraged residents to write their own letters, building an archive of private memories for future generations. Visitors to the website are also encouraged to send their letters to the residents of Al Max, opening a channel of communication to the outside world. Experience the interactive website.Are you a photographer and",2023 Photo Contest,Africa,Open Format ,"This web-based photo project stood out for taking advantage of the range of available tools to tell a unique story about a community of fisher folk in Alexandria. The project’s seamless package of images, audio, handwritten text, maps, and drawings elevated the already excellent selection of photographs. The jury was impressed by the photographer’s thorough research and engagement with the images, which resulted in a holistic story and gave the audience the opportunity to visualize and interact with the issue at hand.",F:\Temp\2023\Mohamed Mahdy,Mohamed Mahdy,2023
