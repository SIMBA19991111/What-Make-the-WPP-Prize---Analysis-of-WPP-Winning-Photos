They cut down trees and bushes, which are turned into charcoal by burning them in clay ovens for three days. This charcoal is then transported to more than 100 steel mills, where it is used as fuel to produce crude iron. Federal reforestation laws are largely ignored. Brazil is one of the world's largest producers of charcoal, almost three-quarters of which comes from an area of virgin savannah twice as large as France, Italy and England put together. The charcoal workers live in poorly equipped campgrounds. The hard work, bad conditions and inhalation of toxic gases add up to an average life expectancy of only 55 years. In the ovens, in an airless atmosphere with temperatures between 500 and 600 degrees centigrade, four cubic meters of wood produce one cubic meter of charcoal.

A mother carries her dead child, wrapped in a shroud according to Muslim custom, to a mass grave for famine victims, outside the town of Bardera, Somalia.

The famine, which claimed the lives of more than 200,000 Somalis, was the result of regional drought and civil war. While a large portion of eastern Africa suffered from this drought in this period, Somalia was the only affected nation, which also faced ongoing war. 

In January 1991, opposing clans overthrew President Siad Barre, who had led the country for 21 years. Thereafter, the centralized Somali state crumbled and the country plunged into a state of lawlessness and social breakdown as clan warlords and their militias fought for power, armed largely with weapons supplied by the United States and the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. In addition to the thousands of civilians wounded and killed in the fighting, the militias also looted food reserves and incoming food aid. In September 1992, the United Nations estimated that half of the aid sent to Somalia was stolen. 

One third to half of Somalia’s total population was internally displaced by this combination of famine and war. Many flocked to the market town of Bardera. On 23 October 1992, The New York Times reported that 11,000 women and children in a refugee camp there were in desperate need of food. But Bardera, a town without any paved roads, was unprepared for the large numbers of refugees. Located at the junction of two heavily mined roads leading to the ports in Mogadishu and Kismayu, Bardera’s packed-dirt airfield could not function in the rain. Only half an hour by air from thousands of tons of food aid, in November Bardera’s death rate nevertheless continued to rise as battles between warring militias halted relief flights.",1st prize,James Nachtwey,1993

In January 1992, the government of El Salvador and the FMLN guerrilla movement signed a treaty to end the 12-year civil war which killed 70,000 and caused one million - a fifth of the total population - to flee the country. It was agreed that the FMLN would become a political party. Shortly before the signing of the peace treaty the army moved into Chalatenango, traditionally an FMLN-controlled area. Assisted by human rights organizations and church organizations, rebels returned to their homes, and the FMLN was being reformed in preparation for the 1994 general election.
