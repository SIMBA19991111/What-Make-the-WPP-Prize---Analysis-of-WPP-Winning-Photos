In April 1974, Edward Kennedy traveled to the Soviet Union to meet Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. He gave a speech at Moscow State University, met with Soviet dissidents and secured an exit visa for the famous Russian cellist Mstislav Rostropovich.

Ken Regan, who accompanied Ted Kennedy to the Soviet Union, made this photo after a lunch meeting with Brezhnev and members of the Supreme Soviet, when Kennedy and Teddy Jr. walked back through the halls of the Kremlin. In an 2011 interview with Culture Brats, Regan said: 'He and his son were walking down the hall and his son, Teddy Jr., had his leg amputated from the knee down maybe three months before. And I just said to myself, ""Let me stop and have them go past me."" They went past me and here they were, the two of them all alone in this hallway. You could see his son's leg bent inward from the operation, and he had a cane. And that was the moment. That picture became iconic, and won first prize at the World Press Contest, and ultimately appeared in both Time and Life magazines.'",1st prize,Ken Regan,1975
