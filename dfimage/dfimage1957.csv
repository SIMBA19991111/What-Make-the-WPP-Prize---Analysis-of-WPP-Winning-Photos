After a string of abuses, Dorothy's family withdrew her from the school after only four days. Children had been enrolling for the new school year and tension was particularly high in the south for districts trying to comply with the US Supreme Court's ruling that states should desegregate their schools with deliberate speed.",1st prize,Douglas Martin,1957

In 1999, photographer Simon E. Smit told De Zilveren Camera, on the occasion of its 50th anniversary, about making the image: 'I was walking on the Veenkade in The Hague, when a man asked me for directions. I told him how to walk and watched him go, when I discovered, seeing his cane and bag, that he was blind. Shortly afterwards, I heard cries for help and a lot of clamor and screaming. Apparently the man had walked straight into the water. As I always carry a camera with me, I could immortalize how this blind man was rescued from the water at the Veenkade.'",2nd prize,Simon E.
