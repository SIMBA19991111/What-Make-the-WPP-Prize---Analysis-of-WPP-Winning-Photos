The promise of freedom and prosperity coupled with the desperate situation at home caused tens of thousands of Cubans to take to the sea in an attempt to reach Florida, 150km across the water. When Fidel Castro lifted Cuba's tight travel restrictions in August the exodus reached a peak, with some 2,000 departures a day. Using hastily built, rickety vessels, countless refugees drowned in the shark-infested seas. The influx of Cubans into the US became a major problem for President Clinton.

The Galerie de Zoologie, a collection of preserved animals, finds its origin in the 19th-century fashion of displaying an exotic, stuffed mammal as a status symbol. A vast, monumental building, it provided an appropriate setting for the giraffes and elephants sent there when they were no longer in vogue. In time, it became home to some 80,000 birds and mammals, a million fish and countless invertebrates. By the 1960s, when the exhibits had cracked and crumbled, the public had moved on to other amusements and the gallery had to close. But in the summer of 1994 the new Galerie d'Evolution reopened, and provides a contemporary context for the zoology museum. The restoration of the animals was a massive project, but the inhabitants have now returned, a fresh glint in their eye and a new shine on their fur or feathers.",3rd prize,François Le Diascorn,1995
