9,Not Specified,1966 Photo Contest,Features,"01 January, 1966",F:\Temp\1966\John Rous,"U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson and Vice President Hubert Humphrey.

In a subtle way, John Rous, has captured the complex relationship between Lyndon Johnson and Hubert Humphrey, which was acknowledged publicly at the time and has been described as one of 'domination and subordination'. When they both served in the U.S. Senate, Humphrey had been Johnson's protégé, and his go-between Johnson's more conservative faction in the Democratic Party and the party's liberal wing. During their term in office, their relationship became one of the most mutually frustrating presidential-vice-presidential relationships in history. Johnson famously manipulated Humphrey by alternately favouring and punishing him. In 1966, when asked by The New York Times whether he favored the renomination of Vice President Humphrey in 1968, Johnson left the question remarkably unanswered.",1st prize,John Rous,1966

Heavy riots broke out on 13 June 1966, when construction workers, who were not members of a trade union, were told that their vacation bonus would be cut down with 2%. During the riots, one of the construction workers died from a heart attack. The Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf, however, reported the following day that he had died from wounds caused by a stone thrown by one of his comrades. Enraged by this one-sided coverage of the story, the workers assaulted De Telegraaf building on the Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal, and the riots came thus to be known as De Telegraaf Riots (De Telegraafrellen).",Honorable mention,Arthur Bastiaanse,1966
